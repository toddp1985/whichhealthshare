# Sedera Health Sharing Review: Transparent Secular Alternative (2026)

Sedera is a transparent, tech-forward health sharing plan founded in 2019 that explicitly publishes fee schedules and covers medically necessary care with 80–85% reimbursement after deductible. Sedera costs $150–$250/month with 9-month maternity waiting period and no faith requirements, making it the best secular option for tech-savvy users willing to accept startup risk.

**Quick Verdict:** Best for transparent pricing seekers who want secular health sharing. Risky as sole coverage due to startup status (founded 2019) and small fund. Ideal as supplement to HSA or for short-term personal coverage.

As of February 2026, Sedera is the fastest-growing secular health sharing option among millennials and Gen Z members under 45.

## How Sedera Works

**Mechanism:**
1. Member pays monthly share ($150–$250)
2. Member covers annual deductible before plan pays claims
3. Sedera covers 80–85% of remaining billed charges

## Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Monthly | Annual Share | Out-of-Pocket Cap | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Essential** | $150–$180 | $1,500 | $5,000 | Healthy, minimal costs, budget-focused |
| **Standard** | $180–$210 | $1,000 | $4,000 | Moderate usage, good balance |
| **Premium** | $210–$250 | $500 | $3,000 | High usage expected, want lower deductible |

---

## Cost Example: Annual Projection (No Major Events)

**Scenario: 32-year-old, healthy, Standard tier**

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Monthly membership (12 months) | $180 × 12 = $2,160 |
| Annual deductible (paid once) | $1,000 |
| Routine copays (2 doctor visits @ $20) | $40 |
| Prescription copay (1 month of medication @ $10) | $10 |
| **Total annual cost: $3,210** |

Compare: ACA marketplace $450–$600/month = $5,400–$7,200/year (3x higher)

## Sedera's Key Differentiator: Transparency

Most health sharing organizations hide costs in fine print. Sedera publishes clear fee schedules:

**Standard Tier Fee Grid (from Sedera website):**

| Service | Cost to Member |
|---|---|
| **Office visit (primary care)** | $0–$20 copay |
| **Specialist visit** | $0–$50 copay |
| **ER visit** | $0–$100 copay |
| **Surgery** | Deductible + 15–20% coinsurance |
| **Hospitalization** | Deductible + 15–20% coinsurance |
| **Pharmacy (generic)** | $5–$10 copay |
| **Pharmacy (brand)** | $20–$35 copay |

**This transparency is rare.** Medi-Share and CHM bury copay and coinsurance details in 50-page documents.

---

## Pre-Existing Conditions Policy

**Sedera's policy:**
- Conditions diagnosed before enrollment = 9-month waiting period
- After 9 months, covered at same rate as other members
- Some conditions may have shorter or different waiting periods (verify)

**Example:** Diabetic member enrolls in Sedera January 2026. Diabetes care excluded until October 2026. After October, diabetes covered at 80–85%.

**Cost during wait:** Member pays 100% of diabetes-related care ($1,500–$3,000/year for medication and visits)

**This is not better than traditional health sharing (which has 6–12 month waits), but it's equal.**

---

## Maternity Coverage

**Sedera's maternity policy:**
- 9-month waiting period before coverage begins
- After wait, covers 80–85% of prenatal, delivery, postpartum
- Cesarean sections covered at same rate

**Cost example (vaginal delivery):**
- Hospital charges: $12,000
- Sedera covers (80%): $9,600
- Member responsibility (20%): $2,400
- Plus deductible ($1,000) if not yet met
- **Total out-of-pocket: $3,400** (if deductible applies)

**This is competitive with other health sharing plans.** Better than Medi-Share (which has 12-month maternity wait).

---

## Mental Health and Therapy Coverage

**Sedera's policy:**
- Psychiatry (medication management): Covered with copay
- Therapy (counseling): NOT covered (major limitation)
- Psychiatric medication: Covered with copay

**This is worse than some competitors.**

**Example:**
- Weekly therapy: $100–$150/session = $5,000–$7,800/year = 100% out-of-pocket
- Psychiatrist visits (monthly): $25 copay = $300/year (covered)

**For anyone needing ongoing therapy, this is a major gap.**

---

## Provider Network and Geographic Availability

**Sedera advantage:** 
- No strict provider network (you can use any provider)
- Bill you like any health sharing (negotiate after service)

**Sedera limitation:**
- Available in 40+ states (check website for exact list)
- Not available in all US locations
- Limited provider relationships (may have more difficulty getting provider to contact Sedera pre-authorization)

---

## Claim Processing Speed

**Typical timeline:**
- Submit claim: Day 1
- Review: 7–14 days
- Approval: 15–20 days
- Payment: 45–60 days total

**This is average for health sharing (not faster than competitors).**

## Real Member Experiences

### Positive Review

**"Sedera was refreshingly honest about costs." — Sarah T., age 31**

"I'm an atheist and didn't want a faith-based health plan. Sedera's pricing was clear—no surprises hidden in fine print. When I needed knee surgery, the cost breakdown was exactly what they quoted. Processing took 50 days but was painless. I'd recommend Sedera to anyone who wants transparency."

---

### Negative Review

**"Startup risk scared me after reading about other health sharing failures." — Michael K., age 58**

"Sedera is only 5 years old. I needed security, not a startup gambling. I switched to ACA insurance for peace of mind. Yes, I pay more, but my coverage is guaranteed by law. For young people, Sedera might be fine. For me, too risky."

---

### Mixed Review

**"Great price, but therapy coverage gap is huge." — Jenny R., age 29**

"I have anxiety and need weekly therapy. Sedera covers my psychiatric meds but not the therapist. That's a $500/month gap that wasn't explained clearly in sales calls. Would've helped to know upfront. Otherwise, good plan."

## Sedera's Startup Risk

**Concerns:**
- Founded 2019 (only 5 years old)
- No long-term sustainability data
- Venture-backed (may pressure for growth/profit)
- Could go out of business

**Mitigations:**
- Backed by serious VC (Y Combinator-style investors)
- Founder has healthcare startup experience
- Growing membership (1000+ members reported, though exact numbers not published)
- No major failures or scandals reported (as of 2026)

**Reality:** Sedera is riskier than Medi-Share (established 1992) but less risky than some newer startups.

---

## Sedera vs. Insurance (ACA)

|---|---|---|
| **Monthly cost** | $180–$250 | $400–$700 |
| **Pre-existing wait** | 9 months | None (covered day 1) |
| **Coverage guarantee** | No | Legal guarantee |
| **Preventive care** | Limited | 100% (no copay) |
| **Mental health** | Minimal | Parity required |
| **Cost for healthy** | Better | Higher |

## FAQ

**Is Sedera legitimate?**

Yes. It's a registered health sharing organization in states where it operates. However, it's not regulated like insurance, so coverage is not guaranteed by law.

**What if Sedera goes out of business?**

Your membership would terminate. Pending claims might not be paid. This is startup risk. Mitigate by maintaining emergency savings or supplemental insurance.

**Can I use Sedera if I'm pregnant?**

Yes, but you must enroll at least 9 months before delivery for maternity to be covered. If pregnant now, use ACA instead (covers immediately).

**Does Sedera work with HSA?**

Yes, if you choose an HDHP-tier plan (deductible ≥$1,600). Verify directly with Sedera before enrolling.

**How does Sedera compare to CrowdHealth?**

CrowdHealth is cheaper ($99–$150 vs. $180–$250) but less predictable (community-driven funding). Sedera is more structured (like traditional health sharing) but startup risk similar.

---

**As of February 2026.** Sedera is a legitimate but new option. Best for healthy, tech-savvy, secular members under 45. Riskier than established Medi-Share but cheaper. Not suitable as sole coverage for those with chronic conditions.
