# Samaritan Ministries Review: Faith-Based Health Sharing (2026)

Samaritan Ministries is a Christian-based health sharing plan founded in 1994 offering $250–$350/month membership with 12-month pre-existing waiting periods and 80–95% claim coverage based on member contributions. Samaritan explicitly requires faith alignment and includes community aspect (prayer requests, member letters) that appeals to Christian households, but lifestyle requirements and moral judgment standards exclude LGBTQ+ members and non-Christians.

**Quick Verdict:** Best for faith-aligned Christian households with stable health and no LGBTQ+ members. Strong community aspect. Expensive for single members. Pre-existing condition waiting period is longest in industry (12 months). Not suitable for pregnant individuals planning delivery within 12 months.

As of February 2026, Samaritan Ministries serves 170,000+ members despite not actively marketing (growth through church referrals only).

## How Samaritan Ministries Works

**Mechanism:**
1. Member pays monthly "share" ($250–$350 individual, $400–$550 family)
2. Member pays annual "publication share" ($500–$1,500) before claims covered
3. Member sends portion of share to other members with medical bills
4. When member has medical need, other members send shares to cover costs
5. Claims approved if medically necessary and member is in good standing

**Faith component:**
- All members pray for each other's medical situations
- Members receive prayer cards with photos of others' medical requests
- Community aspect is central (not just transactional)
- Expectation of mutual support beyond financial

## Cost Example: Annual Projection

**Scenario: 40-year-old, married couple, children (family), Standard plan**

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Monthly share (12 months) | $400 × 12 = $4,800 |
| Annual publication share | $500 |
| Routine copays (3 doctor visits @ $0) | $0 |
| Specialist copay (1 @ $50) | $50 |
| **Total annual cost: $5,350** |

**Compare:**
- ACA marketplace family: $1,200–$1,500/month = $14,400–$18,000/year (3x higher)
- Medi-Share family: $325–$375/month = $3,900–$4,500/year (20% cheaper)

**Samaritan cost advantage for families: 40–60% cheaper than ACA, but more expensive than Medi-Share.**

## The 12-Month Pre-Existing Waiting Period

Samaritan has the longest pre-existing waiting period in the health sharing industry: **12 months.**

**Example:**
- Member diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in January 2026
- Enrolls in Samaritan February 2026
- Diabetes care is NOT covered until February 2027 (full 12 months)
- Member pays 100% for diabetes medication, monitoring, visits ($1,500–$3,000/year)

**Cost impact:**
- 12 months of full premiums: $3,000–$4,200 (individual)
- 12 months of out-of-pocket medical: $1,500–$5,000
- **Total first year: $4,500–$9,200 (vs. no coverage at all)**

**This is the worst pre-existing policy in industry.** Zion has 6 months, Medi-Share has 12, but Samaritan also requires the annual share ($500–$1,000) upfront, creating higher total cost.

---

## Faith Requirements and Lifestyle Restrictions

**Explicit requirement:** "Members must be of Christian faith, committed to biblical principles, and willing to live by Samaritan's ethical guidelines."

**What this means:**
1. Must profess Christian faith
2. Must agree to ethical guidelines
3. Lifestyle enforcement by Samaritan board

**Specific lifestyle requirements:**
- No smoking (violation can cause membership termination)
- Moderate alcohol consumption (heavy drinking grounds for removal)
- Modest dress and behavior
- Adherence to Christian sexual morality (no premarital relations, same-sex relationships)
- No participation in forbidden activities (varies by interpretation)

**Enforcement:** Samaritan monitors through member declarations and community reporting. Violations can result in membership termination and claim denials.

---

## LGBTQ+ and Non-Christian Exclusion

**Samaritan explicitly excludes:**
- Same-sex relationships (may deny membership or terminate)
- Transgender individuals (gender-affirming care never covered)
- Non-Christian faiths (rejected at enrollment)
- Abortion-related care (explicitly forbidden)

**This is intentional.** Samaritan's mission statement includes commitment to "biblical principles," interpreted to exclude LGBTQ+ individuals.

**For LGBTQ+ individuals:** Zion Health, Sedera, or CrowdHealth are better options (explicitly inclusive).

---

## Maternity Coverage

**Samaritan's maternity policy:**
- 12-month waiting period before any pregnancy coverage
- After waiting period, covers 80–95% of prenatal, delivery, postpartum
- Cesarean sections covered at same rate

**Cost example (vaginal delivery):**
- Hospital charges: $12,000
- Samaritan covers (85%): $10,200
- Member responsibility (15%): $1,800
- Plus annual share ($500) if not yet met
- **Total out-of-pocket: $2,300** (if enrolled 12+ months)

**If pregnant before 12-month wait:**
- Zero coverage for maternity
- Must pay 100% ($8,000–$15,000 for delivery)
- Samaritan still requires monthly shares during wait ($3,000–$4,200)
- **Total: $11,000–$19,200 out-of-pocket**

**Verdict:** Don't use Samaritan if planning pregnancy within 12 months.

## Community Aspects (Unique to Samaritan)

Unlike other health sharing plans, Samaritan emphasizes community:

### Prayer Networks

Members receive prayer cards with:
- Photos of members with medical needs
- Description of health situation
- Request for prayer
- Updates on member recovery

**Member testimonial:** "Receiving hundreds of prayer cards knowing people were praying for us meant more than the financial help."

### Member-to-Member Communication

Samaritan facilitates:
- Letters from members in crisis
- Personal prayer requests
- Recovery updates and testimonies
- Faith-based encouragement

### Spiritual Component

Monthly newsletter includes:
- Biblical teachings on health and suffering
- Testimonies of faith during medical crisis
- Encouragement from founder/leaders

**This community aspect is Samaritan's differentiator.** For faith-aligned members, this adds psychological value beyond the financial benefit.

---

## Claim Processing Speed

**Typical timeline:**
- Submit claim: Day 1
- Initial review: 5–10 days
- Approval: 15–30 days
- Payment to member/provider: 30–60 days
- **Total: 45–90 days**

**This is average for health sharing.** Not faster than competitors (Medi-Share averages 42 days).

## Real Member Experiences

### Positive Review

**"The community saved us emotionally and financially." — Pastor David, age 55**

"When my wife needed cancer treatment, our entire church sent prayer cards and letters. Samaritan covered 85% after our annual share. The community aspect made a real difference. We felt truly supported, not just by a company but by a faith family."

---

### Negative Review

**"The 12-month wait was devastating." — Robert, age 38, diabetic**

"I have Type 2 diabetes and didn't know Samaritan would exclude it for 12 full months. I paid $3,600 in shares plus $2,400 for my own diabetes care, and got zero coverage. I wish I'd chosen Medi-Share or insurance. The faith community was nice, but didn't pay my medical bills."

---

### Mixed Review

**"Great for families, but as a single member, it felt expensive." — Lisa, age 32**

"I'm a single Christian woman and appreciated the community. But Samaritan's pricing made sense for families; as a single member, I paid $300/month while family members paid $400 for 4 people. Monthly commitment seemed high relative to my income. Zion Health was significantly cheaper."

## Samaritan's Fund Stability

**Strengths:**
- 30-year operating history (since 1994)
- 170,000+ members (large fund)
- Consistently high claim coverage (~93% historically)
- No major solvency concerns reported

**Concerns:**
- Not as large as Medi-Share (~250,000+ members)

- Are family-oriented (cost advantage for families)
- Value community and spiritual support during medical crises

- Can afford $3,000–$4,200 in annual commitment + deductible

- Are pregnant or planning pregnancy in <12 months
- Need therapy/mental health care

## FAQ

**Does Samaritan cover everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions?**

Yes, eventually. But pre-existing conditions have a 12-month waiting period. After 12 months, they're covered at the same rate as other members.

**What if I'm not Christian but want to join?**

Samaritan requires Christian faith for membership. You'll be rejected at enrollment if you don't profess Christian beliefs. Zion Health or Sedera are secular alternatives.

**Are LGBTQ+ members accepted?**

No. Samaritan's ethical guidelines exclude same-sex relationships and gender-affirming care. LGBTQ+ individuals are not welcome. Use Zion Health, Sedera, or CrowdHealth instead.

**Can I appeal if my claim is denied?**

Yes, you can request reconsideration. However, the appeal process is informal (no legal protections like insurance). Samaritan has final say.

**How much does Samaritan cost for a single person vs. family?**

Individual: $250–$350/month. Family: $400–$550/month (4+ family members pay same as family rate). Single members subsidize family members (common in mutual aid).

---

**As of February 2026.** Samaritan Ministries is a legitimate health sharing plan with 30+ year track record. Best for Christian families with stable health. Not suitable for LGBTQ+ individuals, pregnant members within 12 months, or those with pre-existing conditions needing immediate care.
