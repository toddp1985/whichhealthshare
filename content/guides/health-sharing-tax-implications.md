## Tax Deduction Overview

### Who Can Deduct Health Sharing?

**Can deduct:**
- Self-employed with Schedule C net profit
- S-corporation owners (as guaranteed payment)
- LLC owners (depending on structure)

**Cannot deduct:**
- W-2 employees (unless employer Section 125 plan)
- Retirees (not self-employed)

### Deduction Mechanism

**Schedule C Entry (Self-Employed):**

```

Line 8: Insurance premiums        -$3,000 (health sharing deduction)
Line 9: Net business income       $77,000
```

**Tax calculation:**
- Federal income tax (24% bracket): $77,000 × 0.24 = $18,480
- Self-employment tax (15.3%): $77,000 × 0.153 = $11,781
- **Total tax: $30,261** (vs. $31,740 without deduction)

## Form 8881: Filing the Deduction

**Self-employed must file Form 8881** (Qualified Health Insurance Premiums Deduction) to claim the deduction.

**Instructions:**
1. Calculate net self-employment income (Schedule C, line 9)
2. Determine health sharing premiums paid during tax year
3. Deduction limited to lesser of:
   - Actual premiums paid, OR
   - Your net self-employment income
4. Enter on Form 8881, line 2
5. Transfer deduction to Form 1040, line 21
6. Attach Form 8881 to tax return

---

## State Tax Implications

**Federal deduction:** Applies across all states

**State tax implications:**
- Most states: Follow federal deduction
- Some states (California): May not recognize health sharing as insurance
- Some states (New York): Limited or no deduction

**Check with state tax authority for your specific state.**

---

## Employee Implications (W-2)

**W-2 employees cannot deduct health sharing** unless:

1. **Employer Section 125 Plan:** Employer offers cafeteria plan allowing pre-tax health insurance contributions (rare for health sharing)
2. **Self-employed side income:** If you have Schedule C income, deduct against that (not W-2 wages)

**Example:**
- W-2 job: $50,000 (cannot deduct health sharing)
- Self-employed side business: $15,000 (CAN deduct health sharing against this)
- Health sharing premium: $3,000
- **Deduction applies only to $15,000 income, not $50,000 wage**

---

## Retiree Implications (No Tax Deduction)

**Retirees (not self-employed) cannot deduct health sharing.**

**Tax treatment:**
- Premium paid with post-tax dollars
- No deduction, no tax savings
- Health sharing is only advantage through lower cost

**Example: Retiree age 65, health sharing**
- Monthly premium: $250
- Annual cost: $3,000 (no deduction)
- Compare ACA: $500/month = $6,000/year
- **Savings: $3,000/year through lower premium, not tax deduction**

## Business Structure and Tax Treatment

### Sole Proprietor (Schedule C)

- Health sharing premiums: Deduct on Schedule C, line 8
- Self-employment tax: Full 15.3% applies to net income
- **Simplest structure for deduction**

### LLC (Single-Member)

- Treated as sole proprietor
- Same Schedule C deduction
- **No change from sole proprietor**

### LLC (Multi-Member)

- Treated as partnership
- Each partner's share of premiums deductible on K-1
- **More complex; coordinate with partnership agreement**

### S-Corporation

- Health sharing deducted as guaranteed payment
- Self-employment tax: Only applies to W-2 salary, not distributions
- **More complex but potentially more tax-efficient for high income**

**Example: S-Corp vs. Sole Proprietor ($150k income)**

**Sole Proprietor:**
- Net income: $150,000
- Self-employment tax (15.3%): $22,950
- Plus federal/state tax

**S-Corporation (split $60k salary + $90k distribution):**
- W-2 wages: $60,000
- Self-employment tax (15.3% on wages): $9,180
- Plus federal/state tax on $150,000 income
- **Saves ~$13,770/year in self-employment tax**
- Plus health sharing deduction

## ACA Subsidies and Health Sharing

**Important:** Claiming health sharing premium as tax deduction may affect ACA subsidies.

**ACA subsidy calculation requires:**
- Household income determination
- Health sharing counted as income or deduction? (Varies by interpretation)

**Consult CPA:** If you're considering both ACA subsidies and health sharing deductions, work with accountant to optimize.

---

## Estimated Tax Payments

Self-employed must make quarterly estimated tax payments.

**Health sharing deduction impact:**
- Reduces quarterly estimated tax payments
- Example: Deduction of $3,000/year = ~$750 less per quarterly payment

**Adjustment process:**
- Q1: Calculate estimated tax on expected income
- Subtract health sharing deduction impact
- Pay adjusted quarterly amount
- At tax time: True-up on actual returns

## Common Tax Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Claiming Deduction Without Self-Employment Income

**Wrong:** "I'm a W-2 employee with health sharing; I'll deduct it."

**Reality:** W-2 employees cannot deduct health sharing (unless self-employed side income exists).

**Correct:** Only self-employed with Schedule C net profit can deduct.

---

### Mistake 2: Not Filing Form 8881

**Wrong:** "I'll just put the deduction on Schedule C without Form 8881."

**Reality:** Form 8881 is required. IRS will disallow deduction if form not filed.

**Correct:** File Form 8881 with tax return.

---

### Mistake 3: Deducting More Than Paid

**Wrong:** "I'll deduct $5,000 in health sharing premiums."

**Reality:** Can only deduct what you actually paid.

**Correct:** Keep receipts; deduct actual amount paid.

---

## Record-Keeping for Audit Protection

**Keep documentation for 3+ years:**
1. Bank statements showing premium payments
2. Credit card statements
3. Health sharing plan documents (coverage agreement, member ID)
4. Email confirmations of enrollment
5. Form 8881 filed with return
6. Schedule C showing self-employment income

**If audited:** IRS verifies:
- Health sharing is legitimate (major plans recognized)
- You actually paid the premiums
- Deduction doesn't exceed net self-employment income

---

## Related Tax Planning

**Also consider:**
- HSA contributions (up to $4,300/year, separate from health sharing deduction)
- Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction (may apply to self-employed)
- Health insurance premium tax credit (if ACA instead of health sharing)

## FAQ

**Can I deduct health sharing if I have both W-2 and self-employed income?**

Yes, but only against self-employed income. If you earn $40k W-2 + $20k self-employed, deduct health sharing against $20k (the self-employment side).

**Do I need Form 8881 if I earn under $20,000?**

Yes. Form 8881 is required regardless of income level to claim the deduction.

**Can I deduct health sharing if I'm married and file jointly?**

Yes. If both spouses are self-employed, both can deduct (up to each person's net self-employment income).

**What if I'm semi-retired with some self-employment income?**

Deduct against self-employment income only, not retirement income.

**Are there any income limits on the deduction?**

No. Deduction available to any self-employed with net profit, regardless of income level.
