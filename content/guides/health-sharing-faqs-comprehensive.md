---

## Coverage and Eligibility

### Q: Will health sharing accept me if I apply?

**A:** Most applications are approved if you meet basic criteria:
- Over 18 years old
- No actively contagious disease
- Willing to pay monthly commitment
- Full disclosure of health history

Rejections are rare (<1%) and usually due to fraud concerns or undisclosed terminal illness.

---

### Q: Do I have to disclose my health history?

**A:** Yes. Health sharing applications ask "Have you ever been diagnosed with..." You must disclose all prior diagnoses (this determines pre-existing waiting period).

Lying about medical history can result in claim denial and membership termination.

---

### Q: Is health sharing available for pre-existing conditions?

**A:** Yes, but with a 6–12 month waiting period (varies by plan). You pay full premiums during wait; coverage begins after waiting period expires.

---

### Q: Can I get health sharing if I'm unemployed?

**A:** Yes. Employment status doesn't matter. You just need ability to pay monthly commitment.

---

### Q: Can my dependents have health sharing?

**A:** Yes. Children can be added to family plan (usually at reduced rate or flat family rate). Typically covered until age 18–26.

---

## Costs and Payments

### Q: What does the advertised monthly cost NOT include?

**A:** Monthly cost advertises premium only. Not included:
- Annual share (deductible-like fee: $500–$1,500)
- Copays (specialist: $50–$100)
- Member responsibility percentage (10–30% of remaining bill)
- Facility fees not covered

True cost is 30–50% higher than advertised.

---

### Q: Can I pause or delay payments?

**A:** Depends on plan. Some plans (Samaritan) allow 30-day pause. Others require continuous payments. Ask plan before enrolling if payment flexibility is important.

---

### Q: Do monthly costs increase mid-year?

**A:** Sometimes. Unlike insurance (annual rate guarantees), health sharing can increase rates mid-year. Check plan's track record of rate increases.

---

### Q: What happens if I can't pay my monthly commitment?

**A:** Membership terminates after grace period (7–30 days depending on plan). You lose coverage. Re-enrollment may be subject to new pre-existing waiting period.

---

## Pre-Existing Conditions

### Q: How long is the pre-existing waiting period?

**A:** 
- Zion Health: 6 months
- Sedera: 9 months
- Most others: 12 months
- CrowdHealth: None

---

### Q: If I enroll, then get diagnosed, is new condition pre-existing?

**A:** Yes. Once diagnosed (before pre-existing wait expires), that condition is pre-existing on current plan and carries same waiting period.

**Example:** Enroll January, diagnosed with diabetes June (5 months in). Diabetes waits until January (12 months from enrollment).

---

### Q: Can I reapply after waiting period to reset wait?

**A:** No. Waiting period doesn't reset unless you terminate and re-enroll. Staying with same plan, wait just continues.

---

### Q: What if my pre-existing condition worsens during waiting period?

**A:** Plan covers emergencies (ER, hospitalization) even during pre-existing wait. Non-emergency management (ongoing medication, specialist visits) typically not covered.

---

## Maternity and Pregnancy

### Q: How long is maternity waiting period?

**A:** Most plans: 12 months. Sedera: 9 months. CrowdHealth: None.

---

### Q: Can I use health sharing if I'm already pregnant?

**A:** Technically yes, but pregnancy is pre-existing. 12-month maternity wait means you pay 100% delivery out-of-pocket ($8,000–$15,000). Not cost-effective.

Use ACA instead (covers pregnancy immediately).

---

### Q: Will health sharing cover my newborn?

**A:** Yes. Newborns are covered under parent's family plan from birth (no separate enrollment, no waiting period).

---

### Q: Can I enroll before trying to get pregnant, then pause payments while pregnant?

**A:** Technically maybe (depends on plan), but not practical. Waiting period continues to tick whether you're paying or not (usually). After 12 months, start trying to conceive.

---

## Mental Health

### Q: Does health sharing cover therapy?

**A:** Varies by plan:
- Some plans: No therapy coverage (CHM, Samaritan)
- Some plans: Limited therapy (Zion: 6–10 visits/year)
- Medi-Share: Psychiatric care, but therapy limited

Most plans don't cover ongoing therapy. Budget $100–$150/month for therapy through online platforms or community mental health.

---

### Q: Does health sharing cover psychiatric medication?

**A:** Usually yes, with copay. Psychiatric medications typically covered same as other medications ($5–$50 copay).

---

## Claims and Processing

### Q: How long does it take to get paid after claiming?

**A:** 
- Average: 45–60 days
- Fastest (Medi-Share): 30–45 days
- Slowest (CHM, Samaritan): 60–90 days

---

### Q: What if my claim is denied?

**A:** You can appeal (process is informal, not legal). Appeal success depends on plan discretion. No legal protections like insurance.

---

### Q: Do I submit claims or does the provider?

**A:** Both. Usually provider submits; you can also submit directly. Different plans have different processes.

---

### Q: Can providers bill health sharing directly or do I pay first?

**A:** Some providers bill health sharing directly if they're familiar with the plan. Others require you to pay and submit for reimbursement. Ask provider before procedure.

---

## Comparison Questions

### Q: Is health sharing better than insurance?

**A:** Depends on your situation:
- **Better if:** Young, healthy, self-employed (tax deduction)
- **Worse if:** Pre-existing conditions, need therapy, want guarantees

---

### Q: Can I have both health sharing and insurance?

**A:** Technically yes, but wasteful. Don't do this. Choose one as primary.

---

### Q: How does health sharing compare to Medicaid?

**A:**
- Medicaid (if eligible): Free ($0), covers everything
- Health sharing: $200–$350/month, limited coverage
- If eligible for Medicaid: Use Medicaid (much better)

---

## Lifestyle and Restrictions

### Q: Can LGBTQ+ members join health sharing?

**A:**
- Zion Health: Yes, explicitly inclusive
- Medi-Share: Generally OK, more lenient
- Samaritan: No, excludes same-sex relationships
- CHM: No, Christian-based restrictions

---

### Q: Do I have to be Christian to join?

**A:**

---

## Switching and Enrollment

### Q: How long before coverage begins after enrollment?

**A:** 30–60 days (varies by plan). Plan accordingly if you need coverage soon.

---

### Q: Can I switch plans?

**A:** Yes, but pre-existing waiting period restarts on new plan. Only switch if significant reason (lifestyle conflict, better plan available).

---

### Q: What if I want to leave health sharing?

**A:** Cancel anytime. Provide notice (usually 30 days). No early termination penalties.

---

## Costs and Self-Employed

### Q: As self-employed, how much will health sharing save me in taxes?

**A:** 35–40% savings through Schedule C deduction (self-employment + income tax combined).

**Example:** $3,000 premium × 39.3% tax rate = $1,179 tax savings. Effective cost: $1,821.

---

### Q: Can I pair health sharing with HSA?

**A:** Yes, if health sharing plan has HDHP-compliant deductible ($1,600+). Creates triple tax advantage:
1. HSA contribution (pre-tax)
2. Health sharing deduction (Schedule C)
3. HSA growth (tax-free)

---

## Specific Plans

### Q: What's the difference between Medi-Share and CHM?

**A:**
- Medi-Share: Largest (250k+ members), higher cost, 96% claim pay rate, 12-month wait
- CHM: Cheapest ($180/mo), more restrictive, 89% claim pay rate, 12-month wait

**Choose:** Medi-Share for reliability; CHM for lowest cost

---

### Q: Is Zion good for LGBTQ+ members?

**A:** Yes. Explicitly inclusive, no lifestyle restrictions, no faith requirement. Best secular option.

---

### Q: Should I choose CrowdHealth?

**A:**
- Pros: Cheapest ($99–$150/mo), no waiting period, no faith requirement
- Cons: No funding guarantee, underfunding possible, startup risk (founded 2021)

**Choose if:** Young, healthy, can absorb partial funding

---

## Technical Questions

### Q: Is health sharing the same as insurance?

**A:** No. Health sharing is mutual aid (unregulated). Insurance is regulated (state licensed). Different legal protections.

---

### Q: Does health sharing count as "minimum essential coverage"?

**A:** No. For ACA purposes, health sharing doesn't satisfy coverage requirements. However, individual mandate penalty is $0 as of 2026, so this is moot.

---

### Q: Will health sharing work if I move states?

**A:** Most plans operate nationwide. Verify your specific plan covers your new state. Some plans have regional limitations.

---

## Financial Hardship

### Q: What if I can't afford health sharing?

**A:** 
- If income <138% FPL: Apply for Medicaid (free)
- If income low–moderate: ACA might have subsidies (check healthcare.gov)
- If uninsured: Community health centers offer sliding scale fees

---

### Q: Can I get financial assistance with premiums?

**A:** No. Health sharing organizations don't offer premium assistance. Some may offer payment plans for large deductibles.

---

## Enrollment and Documents

### Q: What documents do I need to enroll?

**A:**
- Proof of age (ID)
- Proof of address (recent bill)
- Medical history (self-reported)
- Payment method (bank account or credit card)

---

### Q: How long does enrollment take?

**A:** Usually 5–10 business days. Coverage begins 30–60 days after enrollment.

---

## Fraud and Honesty

### Q: What happens if I lie on the application?

**A:** Health sharing organizations investigate medical history. Lies about pre-existing conditions can result in:
- Claim denial
- Membership termination
- Demand for repayment of falsely covered claims

---

### Q: What if the organization accuses me of fraud?

**A:** Formal investigation may occur. You have right to respond/appeal. Outcome depends on organization's determination (not legal process).

---

## Planning Questions

### Q: When should I enroll in health sharing?

**A:**
- **Healthy, young:** Anytime (no waiting)
- **Planning pregnancy:** 12 months before conception
- **Pre-existing condition:** Consider ACA instead; if health sharing, enroll soon to start wait
- **Need coverage immediately:** May be too late (30–60 day waiting period)

---

### Q: Can I enroll for just a few months?

**A:** There's no minimum enrollment period, but plans have 30–60 day waiting period before coverage begins. Enrolling for <3 months not practical (won't reach coverage).
