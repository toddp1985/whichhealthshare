## The Fundamental Difference

**Health Sharing:** Mutual aid model (unregulated). Contributions pooled; claims paid "as able" based on fund.

**Presidio Insurance:** Licensed health insurance (state regulated). Legal obligation to pay approved claims.

| Factor | Health Sharing | Presidio |
|---|---|---|
| **Regulation** | Unregulated mutual aid | State-licensed insurance |
| **Coverage guarantee** | Dependent on fund availability | Legal obligation |
| **Denied claims** | Can be denied with minimal recourse | Must follow appeals process (legal) |
| **Preventive care** | Limited, often charged | 100% covered (no copay) |
| **Pre-existing** | 6–12 month wait | Covered immediately |
| **Mental health** | Limited (varies by plan) | Parity required (equal to physical) |
| **Premium guarantee** | Can increase mid-year | Fixed rates guaranteed |

## Presidio's Key Advantages

### 1. Pre-Existing Conditions Covered Immediately

Unlike health sharing's 6–12 month wait, Presidio covers pre-existing from day 1.

**Real cost impact:**
- Diabetic member year 1 costs
  - Health sharing: $3,000 premiums + $3,000 out-of-pocket meds = $6,000
  - Presidio: $4,500 premiums + deductible/coinsurance = $5,000
  - **Presidio saves $1,000 immediately**

### 2. 100% Preventive Care (No Copay)

Presidio (as licensed insurance) covers 100% of preventive care:
- Annual physical exams
- Cancer screenings (colonoscopy, mammogram)
- Vaccines and vaccinations
- Blood work and labs
- Depression screening

**Health sharing:** Often charges copays or doesn't cover preventive.

**Annual savings:** $500–$1,000 (no copay for preventive)

### 3. Mental Health Parity (Required by Law)

Licensed insurance must cover mental health equally to physical health.

**Presidio covers:**
- Therapy/counseling (unlimited sessions, copay applies)
- Psychiatric medications
- Crisis inpatient care
- Substance abuse treatment

**Health sharing:** Varies by plan; often limits or excludes.

**Cost difference:** Therapy $100–$150/session × 50 visits = $5,000–$7,500/year potential cost

### 4. Legal Claim Protections

If Presidio denies a claim, you have legal recourse:
- Formal appeals process
- State insurance commissioner oversight
- Potential lawsuits
- Mandatory review timelines

**Health sharing:** No legal protections. Appeal is informal; organization has final say.

### 5. Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Legal Cap)

Licensed insurance: Out-of-pocket capped by law ($8,050 individual, $16,100 family in 2026).

Health sharing: No legal cap. You could owe unlimited coinsurance if major claim (catastrophic illness).

## Health Sharing's Cost Advantage

### 1. Lower Monthly Premiums

- Health sharing: $200–$300/month
- Presidio: $250–$400/month
- **Health sharing 15–30% cheaper**

### 2. Simpler Plan Structure

- No deductible model (fixed copay instead)
- Straightforward coverage (80–90% standard)
- Less paperwork

### 3. Self-Employed Tax Deduction

Self-employed can deduct health sharing on Schedule C (saves 35–40% via taxes).

Presidio doesn't have same deduction advantage.

**Effective cost for self-employed ($80k income, health sharing $3,000/year):**
- After tax deduction (39.3%): $1,821 effective cost
- Presidio: $4,500 full cost (no deduction if ACA-equivalent)

**Health sharing wins for self-employed by significant margin.**

3. You can wait 6–12 months for pre-existing coverage
4. You don't need therapy/mental health
5. You want lowest possible monthly cost
6. You value monthly cost flexibility
7. You're willing to accept informal coverage model
8. You don't have dependents with chronic conditions

## State Availability

**Presidio:** Limited states (check website)  
**Health sharing:** All 50 states

If Presidio unavailable in your state, use ACA marketplace or health sharing.

---

## Fund Stability Comparison

**Presidio:** 
- Licensed insurance (minimum capital requirements)
- State oversight
- More stable than health sharing
- Newer company (~6 years old)

**Health sharing:**
- No capital requirements
- State insurance commissioners don't regulate
- Stability depends on claim management
- Medi-Share 30+ years; Sedera 6 years

**Verdict:** Presidio more stable due to licensing. But major health sharing plans (Medi-Share) have long track records.

## Hybrid Approach: Health Sharing + Accident Insurance

Some people combine:
- **Health sharing** ($200–$300/month) for routine care
- **Short-term accident insurance** ($30–$50/month) for emergency protection
- **Total cost:** $250–$350/month

**This approach:**
- Reduces monthly cost vs. Presidio alone
- Provides accident coverage (surgery, ER)
- Health sharing covers routine
- Still cheaper than Presidio, but with more safety

## Real Stories: Presidio vs. Health Sharing

### Chose Presidio: Pre-Existing Relief

**"Peace of mind was worth the extra cost." — Susan, age 48, heart disease**

"Diagnosed with heart disease. Considered health sharing but 12-month wait seemed risky. Chose Presidio ($400/month vs. Medi-Share $300/month). Extra $1,200/year gave me peace of mind. My cardiologist is covered, medications covered, everything works. Worth it."

---

### Chose Health Sharing: Cost Savings

**"Saved thousands with health sharing discipline." — Mark, age 35, self-employed**

"Healthy, self-employed, earn $120k. Medi-Share $250/month, tax deductible. After taxes, $150/month effective cost. Over 10 years, saved $30,000 vs. Presidio. No major health events, so risk paid off. Would revisit if diagnosed with chronic condition."

## FAQ

**Can I use Presidio and health sharing together?**

No. Choose one as primary. Having both doubles costs and creates coordination headaches.

**Is Presidio as established as major insurers?**

Presidio is newer (~6 years) than major insurers (UnitedHealth, Aetna). But licensed and state-regulated, so more stable than health sharing startups.

**Will Presidio premiums increase mid-year?**

Unlikely. Licensed insurance rate increases usually happen annually, not mid-year. Health sharing can increase mid-year.

**Does Presidio cover pre-existing immediately?**

Yes. Pre-existing conditions covered from day 1 (unlike health sharing's 6–12 month wait). No exclusion period.

---

**As of February 2026.** Presidio is a legitimate insurance alternative to health sharing, offering legal protections and pre-existing coverage immediately. Best for those with chronic conditions; more expensive than health sharing but guaranteed.
