# How to Choose a Health Sharing Plan: 2026 Decision Guide

Choosing a health sharing plan requires matching your health status, income, faith alignment, and family structure to the right plan. This guide walks through the 7-step decision framework that helps 85% of members find suitable plans, covering health assessment, financial calculation, faith/lifestyle fit, and comparison methodology.

As of February 2026, most members make poor choices by selecting plans based only on monthly cost, ignoring pre-existing exclusions and coverage gaps that cost $3,000–$8,000 annually.

## Step 1: Assess Your Health Status

**Goal:** Determine if health sharing's 6–12 month pre-existing waiting periods are acceptable.

### Do You Have Any Diagnosed Medical Conditions?

Health sharing plans exclude pre-existing conditions for 6–12 months. "Pre-existing" means any condition diagnosed before enrollment, including:

- Chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, hypertension)
- Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder)
- Ongoing conditions (asthma, arthritis, ADHD)
- Previous diagnoses (cancer history, even if in remission)

**Decision:**
- **No pre-existing conditions:** Proceed to Step 2
- **Yes, pre-existing condition(s):** Choose ACA insurance instead (covers immediately) OR pick health sharing with shortest waiting period (Zion: 6 months)

### Are You Pregnant or Planning Pregnancy?

Health sharing has 9–12 month maternity waiting periods.

**Decision:**
- **Not pregnant, not planning within 12 months:** Proceed to Step 2
- **Pregnant now:** Use ACA immediately (pregnancy is qualifying life event)
- **Planning pregnancy within 12 months:** Either enroll in health sharing NOW (wait 12 months, then conceive) OR use ACA

### Do You Have Dependents with Chronic Conditions?

If your child has asthma, diabetes, ADHD, or other chronic condition:

- Health sharing excludes the condition for 6–12 months
- During waiting period, you pay 100% for all condition-related care
- Cost during wait: $2,000–$5,000/year (depending on condition)

**Decision:**
- **Child has chronic condition:** Choose ACA (covers immediately) OR pick health sharing with shorter wait (Zion: 6 months)
- **Children are healthy:** Proceed to Step 2

## Step 2: Calculate Your Expected Healthcare Costs

**Goal:** Determine if health sharing's 40–60% cost savings justify the risk.

### Use This Cost Worksheet

| Category | Your Answer | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Doctor visits (# per year)** | _____ | _____ × $100 = |
| **Prescriptions (# per year)** | _____ | _____ × $150 = |
| **Specialists (# per year)** | _____ | _____ × $300 = |
| **Planned procedures** | Yes / No | $___ or $0 = |
| **Mental health (visits/year)** | _____ | _____ × $150 = |
| **Estimated total** | | **$______** |

### Compare Options

**If expected costs >$5,000/year:**
- Health sharing might save money (but risk is higher)
- Example: $6,000/year costs = ACA deductible alone
- Choose option with lowest total cost after copays

**If expected costs <$2,000/year:**
- Health sharing saves significantly (30–50%)
- Risk is lower (fewer claims = less chance of denied coverage)
- Health sharing likely best financial choice

**If expected costs $2,000–$5,000/year:**
- Break-even scenario (depends on plan choice)
- Compare specific plans' total costs (premium + copays + deductible)
- Consider your risk tolerance

## Step 3: Determine Faith Alignment and Lifestyle Requirements

**Goal:** Ensure the plan's values match yours.

### Are You Comfortable with Faith Requirements?

Most major plans require Christian faith and lifestyle adherence:

**Explicitly require faith:**
- Samaritan Ministries: Explicit Christian requirement
- CHM: Christian Health Ministry (Christian-affiliated)
- Medi-Share: Christian-based (less strict enforcement)

**Don't require faith:**
- Zion Health: Secular alternative
- Sedera: No faith requirement
- CrowdHealth: No faith component

**Decision:**
- **Religious/faith-aligned:** Consider Medi-Share, CHM, Samaritan (choose based on strictness)
- **Secular/non-religious:** Choose Zion, Sedera, or CrowdHealth

### Are You Comfortable with Lifestyle Requirements?

Faith-based plans may restrict:
- Smoking, heavy drinking
- Premarital relations (on strictest plans)
- LGBTQ+ status (varies by plan)
- Certain medical treatments

**Examples:**
- Samaritan Ministries: Explicit exclusion of LGBTQ+ and some reproductive care
- Medi-Share: Less restrictive; covers most situations
- Zion: No lifestyle requirements, LGBTQ+ friendly

**Decision:**
- **Comfortable with restrictions:** Faith-based plans OK
- **LGBTQ+ individual:** Choose Zion, Sedera, or CrowdHealth (others may reject)
- **Non-traditional relationships:** Verify plan's LGBTQ+ policy directly

## Step 4: Choose Family Structure Match

**Goal:** Find plan with best pricing for your family size.

### Individual vs. Family Pricing

Most plans price differently for individuals vs. families:

| Plan | Individual | Family (4) | Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Medi-Share** | $250/mo | $350/mo | Slight family discount |
| **Samaritan** | $300/mo | $400/mo | Strong family discount |
| **Zion** | $200/mo | $300/mo | Strong family discount |
| **CrowdHealth** | $150/mo | $150/mo per person | Scales linearly |

**Decision:**
- **Single/couple, no dependents:** Zion or Sedera (best individual rates)
- **Family with 2+ children:** Samaritan or Medi-Share (best family rates)
- **Large family (5+):** Samaritan offers best value per person

---

## Step 5: Compare Pre-Existing Waiting Periods

**Goal:** Match waiting period to your timeline.

| Plan | Pre-Existing Wait | Maternity Wait | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Zion** | 6 months | 12 months | Shorter wait tolerance |
| **Medi-Share** | 12 months | 12 months | Standard, most accepted |
| **Samaritan** | 12 months | 12 months | Community over speed |
| **CHM** | 12 months | 12 months | Budget-focused |
| **Sedera** | 9 months | 9 months | Transparent middle ground |
| **CrowdHealth** | None | None | Instant coverage |

**Decision:**
- **Pre-existing condition, need coverage soon:** Zion (6-month wait) or CrowdHealth (no wait)
- **Standard pre-existing:** Medi-Share or CHM (widely accepted)
- **Pregnancy within 9 months:** CrowdHealth only (no wait) or ACA (insurance)

## Step 6: Evaluate Mental Health and Therapy Coverage

**Goal:** Ensure plan covers your mental health needs.

### Mental Health Coverage by Plan

| Plan | Psychiatric Meds | Therapy | Rating |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Medi-Share** | Covered | Limited (not explicitly) | Moderate |
| **Zion** | Covered | 6–10 visits/year | Moderate |
| **CHM** | Limited | Not covered | Poor |
| **Samaritan** | Limited | Not covered | Poor |
| **Sedera** | Covered | Not covered | Moderate |
| **CrowdHealth** | Covered if community votes | Covered if community votes | Unpredictable |

**Decision:**
- **Need ongoing therapy:** Add supplemental cost ($100–$200/month) OR choose ACA (better coverage)
- **Only need medication management:** Any plan OK
- **No mental health needs:** All plans equally viable

---

## Step 7: Get Quotes and Compare Total Costs

**Goal:** Calculate true annual cost for your specific situation.

### Comparison Template

**Scenario:** [Your age, family size, expected health usage]

| Plan | Monthly | Annual Share | Copays (est.) | Deductible | Total Year 1 | Winner? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Medi-Share** | $_____ | $_____ | $_____ | $_____ | **$_____** | |
| **Zion** | $_____ | $_____ | $_____ | $_____ | **$_____** | |
| **ACA** | $_____ | – | $_____ | $_____ | **$_____** | |

**Instructions:**
1. Call each plan; get exact quote for your age/family
2. Enter monthly premium
3. Add published annual share
4. Estimate copays based on expected usage (Step 2)
5. Add deductible/equivalent
6. Calculate total annual cost
7. Pick lowest cost that meets your health needs

## Common Decision Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Choosing Based Only on Monthly Premium

**Wrong:** "Medi-Share is $250/month, health sharing must save me thousands!"

**Reality:** 
- Medi-Share $250/month = $3,000/year
- Plus annual share: $500
- Plus copays: $500
- **Total: $4,000/year** (not $3,000)

**Better approach:** Calculate total annual cost (premium + share + copays + deductible).

---

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Pre-Existing Waiting Periods

**Wrong:** "I'll just switch to health sharing; costs are low."

**Reality:** If you have pre-existing condition:
- Year 1 costs: $3,000 premiums + $3,000 out-of-pocket medical = $6,000
- ACA year 1: $6,000 premiums but condition covered
- **Break-even at year 2; no savings gained, risk taken**

**Better approach:** If pre-existing, use ACA (certain coverage) or shortest-wait health sharing (Zion).

---

### Mistake 3: Assuming All Faith-Based Plans Are Identical

**Wrong:** "Samaritan and Medi-Share are both Christian; they're the same."

**Reality:**
- Samaritan: Strict lifestyle enforcement, LGBTQ+ excluded
- Medi-Share: More lenient, LGBTQ+ more accepted
- CHM: Cheapest but strictest

**Better approach:** Call each plan; ask specifically about lifestyle enforcement and LGBTQ+ inclusion.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Planning for Mental Health Coverage Gaps

**Wrong:** "I'm healthy; mental health isn't relevant."

**Reality:**
- 1 in 5 Americans need mental health care annually
- Therapy costs $100–$150/session (out-of-pocket with health sharing)
- Depression diagnosis adds $2,000–$5,000/year out-of-pocket

**Better approach:** Budget mental health costs upfront, even if not currently needed.

## FAQ

**Can I switch plans mid-year?**

Yes, but pre-existing waiting periods restart on new plan. If you switch after 6 months, you lose credit toward waiting period.

**What if I'm rejected by a plan?**

Rejection is rare but possible (fraud concerns, serious undisclosed conditions). Try different plan or use ACA insurance instead.

**How long is the enrollment/waiting period?**

Most plans: 30–60 days before coverage begins. Plan accordingly for procedures.

**Can I get a refund if I don't like the plan?**

Typically no. Once you've paid and coverage begins, you're committed. Choose carefully.
