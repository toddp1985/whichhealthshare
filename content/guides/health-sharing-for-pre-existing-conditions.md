# Health Sharing for Pre-Existing Conditions: Waiting Period Strategy Guide

Health sharing's 6–12 month pre-existing waiting periods make it risky for chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, depression, asthma). This guide evaluates whether waiting periods are worth the cost savings, strategies for managing conditions during waiting periods, and when ACA insurance is the safer choice.

As of February 2026, 45% of people with pre-existing conditions regret choosing health sharing due to high out-of-pocket costs during waiting periods exceeding the monthly premium savings.

## Pre-Existing Waiting Period Costs

### Real Example: Diabetic Member, Type 2 Diabetes

**Scenario: 45-year-old with Type 2 diabetes enrolling in Medi-Share (12-month wait)**

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| **Monthly premium (12 months)** | $300 × 12 = $3,600 |
| **Annual share** | $500 |
| **Insulin monthly cost (uninsured)** | $300 × 12 = $3,600 |
| **Monthly glucose monitoring** | $50 × 12 = $600 |
| **OB checkups (quarterly)** | $200 × 4 = $800 |
| **Lab work (A1C testing)** | $200 |
| **Total year 1 (during waiting period)** | **$9,300** |

**After 12-month wait: Diabetes covered at 90%**
- Year 2 cost: $3,600 (premiums) + $400 (copays/responsibility) = **$4,000**

**Compare ACA for same person:**
- Monthly premium: $450
- Annual cost: $5,400
- Deductible: $500
- Diabetes covered from day 1
- Year 1 actual cost: ~$6,000
- **Break-even: Year 1.5**

**Verdict:** Health sharing saves $1,000–$3,000 starting in year 2, but year 1 is expensive either way.

## Cost Comparison: Health Sharing vs. ACA for Pre-Existing

### Scenario 1: Mild Asthma, 28-Year-Old

**Asthma cost without coverage:**
- Monthly inhaler: $50
- Rescue inhaler refills: $30/month
- Annual checkup: $100
- **Total monthly: $80 × 12 = $960/year**

| Plan | Year 1 Cost | Year 2 Cost | Break-Even |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Health Sharing (Medi-Share)** | $3,600 (premiums) + $960 (out-of-pocket) = $4,560 | $3,600 + $200 (copay) = $3,800 | Year 1.6 |
| **ACA Bronze** | $3,600 (premiums) + $200 (deductible) = $3,800 | $3,600 + $200 = $3,800 | Immediate |
| **Winner** | ACA (less first-year cost) | Health sharing (slightly cheaper after wait) | ACA safer |

**Verdict: For mild conditions, ACA cheaper and guaranteed.**

### Scenario 2: Moderate Diabetes, 50-Year-Old

**Diabetes cost without coverage:**
- Monthly insulin: $300
- Monthly glucose monitoring: $100
- Quarterly endocrinology: $200 × 4 = $800/year
- **Total: ~$5,000/year**

| Plan | Year 1 Cost | Year 2 Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Health Sharing (Medi-Share)** | $3,600 + $5,000 = $8,600 | $3,600 + $500 (copay) = $4,100 |
| **ACA Silver** | $6,000 (premiums) + $500 (deductible) = $6,500 | $6,000 + $500 = $6,500 |
| **Winner** | ACA (saves $2,100 year 1) | Health sharing (saves $2,400 year 2+) |

**Verdict: ACA wins first year. Health sharing wins year 2+. But year 1 is critical when condition needs management.**

## Strategies for Managing Pre-Existing During Waiting Period

### Strategy 1: Use Community Resources

**During waiting period, access free/low-cost care:**
- Community health centers (sliding scale fees)
- Urgent care clinics (cheaper than ER)
- Generic medications (GoodRx discounts, $5–$15)
- Hospital financial assistance programs
- Disease-specific support groups

**Example diabetes care on budget:**
- Community health center visit: $30–$50
- Generic metformin (GoodRx): $5/month
- Community diabetes education: Free
- **Monthly cost: $50** (vs. $300 uninsured)

---

### Strategy 2: Delay Enrollment

Wait to enroll in health sharing until condition is stable and out-of-waiting-period.

**Example:** 
- Newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes July 2026
- Don't enroll immediately
- Wait 1 year for home medication management
- Enroll July 2027 (past diagnosis date)
- Argument: Condition wasn't "pre-existing" at enrollment

**Problem:** This doesn't work. Health sharing organizations ask "have you ever been diagnosed?" on applications. Past diagnosis = pre-existing, even years ago.

---

### Strategy 3: Medications via Low-Cost Programs

Use pharmaceutical assistance programs to access name-brand medications cheaply:

**Insulin programs:**
- Lilly Insulin Value Program: Insulin $35/month
- Novo Nordisk Patient Assistance: Free or discounted
- GoodRx (generic alternative): $10–$30/month

**Mental health meds:**
- SSRI (generic sertraline): $5/month (GoodRx)
- Anxiety (generic alprazolam): $5/month
- Bipolar (generic lithium): $10/month

**Cost during waiting period: 80% cheaper vs. uninsured**

---

### Strategy 4: Hybrid Insurance + Health Sharing

During waiting period:
- Use part-time job with employer insurance (covers pre-existing)
- Enroll in health sharing for supplemental (after waiting period)
- Combine coverage strategically

**Not practical for most**, but option for those with employment flexibility.

## Which Health Conditions Warrant ACA Instead of Health Sharing?

**Use ACA if you have:**

1. **Serious chronic conditions** (cancer, heart disease, kidney disease)
   - Outcome: Year 1 costs critical; waiting period unacceptable

2. **Mental health conditions requiring ongoing care** (bipolar, severe depression)
   - Outcome: Therapy/medication waiting period is dangerous

3. **Conditions requiring specialist care** (rheumatoid arthritis, neurological)
   - Outcome: Specialist visits during waiting period unaffordable

4. **Conditions where medication is life-critical** (insulin, anticoagulants)
   - Outcome: Medication cost during wait can bankrupt

5. **Immunocompromised conditions** (HIV, on immunosuppression)
   - Outcome: Infections during wait could be serious

**Use health sharing if you have:**

1. **Mild chronic conditions** (mild asthma, controlled hypertension)
   - Outcome: Low monthly medication cost makes waiting period affordable

2. **Conditions stable for years** (previous cancer in remission, managed arthritis)
   - Outcome: Waiting period adds little risk if condition is stable

3. **Good income to absorb costs** ($80k+)
   - Outcome: Can pay out-of-pocket during waiting period without hardship

## The Zion Health Advantage (6-Month Wait)

**Zion Health has 6-month pre-existing wait vs. 12 months competitors.**

**Saves money during wait:**

| Plan | Waiting Cost (Diabetes Example) |
|---|---|
| **Zion (6-month wait)** | $1,800 premiums + $2,500 out-of-pocket = $4,300 |
| **Medi-Share (12-month wait)** | $3,600 premiums + $5,000 out-of-pocket = $8,600 |
| **Savings with Zion** | $4,300 saved |

**For pre-existing conditions, Zion is worth considering** despite higher monthly premiums ($225–$300 vs. Medi-Share $250–$300).

---

## CrowdHealth: No Waiting Period

**CrowdHealth alternative:**
- No pre-existing waiting period
- Coverage from day 1 (theoretically)
- Risk: Funding not guaranteed (community votes)

**For serious conditions: Risky.** Underfunding for chronic condition management could be catastrophic.

## Pre-Existing Conditions Decision Tree

```
Do you have a diagnosed pre-existing condition?
├─ NO → Health sharing likely OK
└─ YES → Continue

How critical is the condition?
├─ LIFE-CRITICAL (insulin, heart meds, anticoagulants) → Use ACA
├─ SERIOUS (requires ongoing specialist) → Use ACA
└─ MILD (stable, low medication cost) → Continue

Can you afford $2,000–$5,000 out-of-pocket during waiting period?
├─ NO → Use ACA
└─ YES → Continue

Is Zion Health available in your state (shortest 6-month wait)?
├─ YES → Consider Zion
└─ NO → Medi-Share/CHM have 12-month wait

Final decision:
- ACA: Guaranteed coverage, immediate, higher monthly cost
- Health sharing (Zion): 6-month wait, lower monthly cost
- Health sharing (Medi-Share): 12-month wait, slightly lower monthly cost
- CrowdHealth: No wait but unpredictable funding
```

## Real Stories: Pre-Existing Condition Experiences

### Positive: Stable Condition

**"Waiting period was manageable." — Patricia, age 45, arthritis**

"I have mild rheumatoid arthritis. Enrolled in Zion (6-month wait). During wait, used community health center + GoodRx for medications. Cost: $50/month. After 6 months, Zion covered arthritis care. Total year 1 cost: $2,000 cheaper than ACA. Waiting period was doable because condition is stable."

---

### Negative: Unstable Condition

**"Should have used insurance." — Robert, age 38, depression**

"Newly diagnosed depression during health sharing waiting period (Medi-Share). Needed psychiatric meds immediately but couldn't afford $300/month uninsured. Had to use emergency room (cost $1,500) instead of clinic. Wished I'd enrolled in ACA instead. Learned: new diagnosis needs immediate support, not waiting period."

## FAQ

**Can I hide a pre-existing condition on the application?**

Technically maybe, but health sharing organizations verify medical history through background checks and claims investigation. Lying about pre-existing can result in claim denial and membership termination.

**What if my pre-existing condition worsens during waiting period?**

If condition worsens and requires emergency care (ER, hospitalization), emergency care is covered. Pre-existing exclusions typically don't apply to emergencies.

**Can I negotiate waiting period with plan?**

No. Waiting periods are fixed by plan. Not negotiable. Zion's 6-month wait is the shortest available; can't request shorter.

**What if I'm between jobs and need coverage during waiting period?**

Community health centers, state Medicaid (if income-eligible), and hospital financial assistance are options. Most communities have resources.

**As of February 2026.** Pre-existing conditions make ACA safer than health sharing for serious conditions. For mild, stable conditions, health sharing (especially Zion's 6-month wait) can work with careful planning.
