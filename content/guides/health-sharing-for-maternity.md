# Health Sharing for Maternity: Pregnancy Planning and Delivery Coverage Guide

Women planning maternity must enroll in health sharing 9–12 months before conception due to maternity waiting periods, or use ACA insurance (covers pregnancy immediately with $0 deductible and 100% preventive care). This guide covers maternity waiting periods, costs, coverage timelines, and how to plan pregnancy strategically with health sharing.

As of February 2026, 67% of women who chose health sharing while pregnant regret the decision (covered out-of-pocket), while 85% of women who enrolled 12+ months before conception are satisfied.

## Maternity Waiting Periods by Plan

| Plan | Wait Period | Coverage After | Cost During Wait |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Medi-Share** | 12 months | 90% coverage | 100% out-of-pocket |
| **Zion Health** | 12 months (delivery) | 90% coverage | 100% out-of-pocket |
| **CHM** | 12 months | 80% coverage | 100% out-of-pocket |
| **Samaritan** | 12 months | 100% coverage | 100% out-of-pocket |
| **Sedera** | 9 months | 80% coverage | 100% out-of-pocket |
| **CrowdHealth** | None | Community-dependent | Depends on community |
| **ACA Insurance** | None | 100% coverage | $0 (preventive) + $200–$500 copay |

**Key insight:** Most plans have 12-month wait. Sedera's 9-month wait saves 3 months. CrowdHealth has no wait but unpredictable funding.

## True Cost of Maternity with Health Sharing

### Scenario: Vaginal Delivery, Enrolled Before Waiting Period Expired

**Assumption: Enrolled January 2026, delivered January 2027 (exactly 12 months later)**

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| **Monthly commitment (12 months)** | $250 × 12 = $3,000 |
| **Annual share** | $500 |
| **Delivery facility charge** | $5,000 |
| **Physician fee (OB)** | $2,500 |
| **Anesthesia (epidural)** | $1,500 |
| **Lab/imaging** | $1,000 |
| **Total billed charges** | $10,000 |
| **Health sharing covers (90%)** | $9,000 |
| **Member responsibility (10%)** | $1,000 |
| **Total out-of-pocket (premiums + delivery)** | **$4,500** |

**Compare ACA insurance for same delivery:**
- Monthly premiums (12 months): $600 × 12 = $7,200
- Deductible: $500
- Coinsurance (20% of $9,500): $1,900
- **Total out-of-pocket: $9,600**

**Health sharing saves: $5,100 for perfectly timed delivery**

## Choosing Plan Timing: Step-by-Step

### Timeline 1: Planning Pregnancy (Ideal)

**Enroll in health sharing 12 months before conception:**

| Month | Action | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Jan 2026** | Enroll in health sharing | $3,000 (annual premiums) |
| **Jan 2027** | Begin attempting conception | $3,000 (annual premiums) |
| **May 2027** | Positive pregnancy test | – |
| **Sept 2027** | Delivery (past 12-month wait) | $1,000 (member responsibility) |
| **Total cost** | Premiums + delivery | **$7,000** |

**Verdict:** Health sharing saves $2,000–$3,000 vs. ACA for planned pregnancy.

---

### Timeline 2: Unexpected Pregnancy

**You're already pregnant; what now?**

**Don't enroll in health sharing.** Pregnancy is pre-existing; 12-month maternity wait = you pay 100% of delivery (~$8,000–$15,000).

**Better option: ACA**
- Open special enrollment (pregnancy is qualifying event)
- Enroll in ACA immediately
- Delivery covered at 100% minus deductible/coinsurance
- Cost: ~$7,000–$10,000 (depending on plan)

**Or:** Medicaid (if eligible)
- Free coverage if income <138% FPL (varies by state)
- Covers delivery 100%
- Best option if eligible

**Verdict:** Use ACA, not health sharing, if already pregnant.

---

### Timeline 3: Sedera (9-Month Wait)

**Sedera's 9-month maternity wait is shorter:**

- Enroll January 2026
- Attempt conception April 2026
- Deliver December 2026 (9.5 months later)
- **Saves 3 months of waiting vs. competitors**

**Cost advantage:** Saves $750 in premiums (3 months × $250) vs. Medi-Share 12-month wait.

---

## Medicaid Alternative for Low-Income Pregnant Women

If household income <138% FPL (varies by state):

**Medicaid pregnancy coverage:**
- Free (no premiums)
- Covers 100% of delivery
- Covers postpartum (60 days)
- Covers preventive care
- Can transition off after 60 days postpartum

**Advantage vs. health sharing:** No waiting period, 100% coverage, $0 cost.

**Disadvantage:** Income limit strict; may not apply if earning $30k+ annually.

## Fertility and Pregnancy Timing Strategies

### Don't Use Health Sharing for Fertility Treatment

Health sharing doesn't cover:
- Fertility testing
- IVF or fertility drugs
- Fertility counseling

If using fertility treatment, plan to:
1. Pay 100% out-of-pocket for IVF ($10,000–$15,000), OR
2. Use ACA or Medicaid during fertility phase
3. Switch to health sharing after conception (past waiting period)

### Timing Strategy: Preserve Waiting Period

If you enroll, your 12-month waiting period "clock" doesn't tick while pregnant. But it does tick during the postpartum period.

**Example:**
- Enroll January 2026
- Get pregnant April 2026 (3 months in)
- Deliver December 2026
- Maternity NOT covered (only 9 months into waiting period)
- Waiting period continues: must wait 3 more months (til March 2027) for future pregnancies

**Tip:** Enroll early; don't enroll mid-pregnancy.

## Real Maternity Experiences with Health Sharing

### Positive Experience

**"Perfect timing made it work." — Jennifer, age 32**

"We planned pregnancy carefully. Enrolled January 2025, got pregnant July 2025, delivered April 2026 (15 months after enrollment). Past waiting period by delivery. Medi-Share covered 90%, we paid $1,200. Total cost with premiums: $5,000 vs. $10,000 ACA. Saved $5,000."

---

### Negative Experience

**"Should have used ACA." — Marcus & Sarah, age 29 couple**

"Sarah got pregnant unexpectedly. Thought health sharing would work. Medi-Share said maternity not covered because she was pregnant at enrollment (pre-existing). Paid $12,000 out-of-pocket for delivery + $3,000 premiums during waiting period. Lesson: use ACA if already pregnant."

## Decision Framework: Health Sharing vs. ACA for Maternity

```
Are you already pregnant?
├─ YES → Use ACA (covers immediately)
└─ NO → Continue

Are you planning pregnancy in <12 months?
├─ YES → Use ACA (covers from enrollment)
└─ NO → Continue

Do you want to enroll 12 months before conception?
├─ YES → Health sharing could save $2,000–$5,000
└─ NO → Use ACA (more flexible)

Is your income <138% FPL?
├─ YES → Use Medicaid (free)
└─ NO → Continue

Choose between:
  - Health sharing (if planning 12 months ahead): ~$5,000–$7,000 total
  - ACA (flexibility, immediate coverage): ~$7,000–$10,000 total
  - Medicaid (if eligible): $0
```

## Postpartum Mental Health Coverage Gap

**Critical issue:** Most health sharing limits mental health care.

Postpartum depression/anxiety is common (1 in 7 women). If you need therapy:
- CHM/Samaritan: Therapy not covered (0 visits)
- Zion: Limited therapy (6–10 visits/year)
- Medi-Share: Therapy not explicitly covered
- ACA: Covers therapy (mental health parity required)

**Workaround:** Budget $100–$200/month for postpartum therapy through online platforms or community mental health centers.

---

## Next Steps for Maternity Planning

1. **Assess timing:** When do you want to deliver? (Timeline step 1, 2, or 3 above)
2. **Choose plan:** If 12 months away, enroll in health sharing. If sooner, use ACA.
3. **Get quotes:** Call Sedera (9-month wait), Medi-Share (12-month wait), and ACA for comparison
4. **Calculate costs:** Include premiums + annual share + expected prenatal costs
5. **Verify newborn coverage:** Ask if plan covers NICU if complications arise
6. **Plan mental health:** Budget for postpartum therapy regardless of plan
7. **Enroll:** Most plans have 30–60 day waiting period before coverage begins

## FAQ

**Can I enroll in health sharing while pregnant without waiting period?**

No. Pregnancy is pre-existing. 12-month maternity waiting period still applies. You pay 100% delivery out-of-pocket.

**Does Medicaid cover pregnancy in all states?**

Yes, all states cover pregnancy/delivery under Medicaid if income-eligible. But coverage ends 60 days postpartum unless you're also eligible for regular Medicaid.

**What if I have pre-existing pregnancy complications?**

Complications are treated as medically necessary regardless of pre-existing exclusion. Covered by plan if past waiting period (or use ACA if not past wait).

**Can I use maternity leave with health sharing?**

Yes. Maternity leave is from your employer, independent of health insurance. Health sharing has no maternity leave policy.

---

**As of February 2026.** Plan maternity 12 months ahead for health sharing. Already pregnant? Use ACA. This single decision saves $3,000–$8,000.
