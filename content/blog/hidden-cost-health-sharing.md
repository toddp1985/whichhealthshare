# The Hidden Cost of Health Sharing Nobody Talks About

Health sharing's advertised monthly cost ($225–$350) omits 30–50% of actual spending: annual shares, copays, specialist fees, and member responsibility percentages. But there's a hidden cost even deeper than these—the **opportunity cost of unmanaged health conditions** during pre-existing waiting periods. Women delay starting therapy during the 12-month wait. Diabetics skip specialist visits to save money. The financial consequence is often worse than what insurance would have cost.

## The Advertised Cost vs. The Real Cost

You see the ad: "**Health sharing from $225/month**"

Here's what that includes: Your monthly contribution to the shared fund. That's it.

Here's what it doesn't include:
- Annual share ($500–$2,000): Paid once yearly before coverage starts
- Specialist copay ($50–$100): Per visit
- Prescription copay ($10–$50): Per medication
- Member responsibility (10–30%): Your share of every billed charge after organization pays

**Real cost calculation (individual, Medi-Share):**
- Monthly: $250
- Annual share: $500
- 3 doctor visits @ $50 copay: $150
- 2 prescriptions @ $30: $60
- One specialist visit @ $100: $100
- Estimated coinsurance on small claims: $100
- **Real annual cost: $5,160** (not $3,000)

The spread is ~70% higher than the advertised price.

Most members discover this gap only after enrollment. By then, they've paid for months before realizing the true cost.

## The Opportunity Cost Nobody Quantifies

Here's the hidden cost that's worse than anything financial: **conditions that go untreated during waiting periods.**

**Scenario: 38-year-old woman with new-onset depression**

She enrolled in health sharing 6 months ago when diagnosed. Depression is pre-existing; she's in year 1 of 12-month wait. Medi-Share doesn't cover therapy. Cost of weekly therapy: $100–$150/session.

Decision tree:
- **Option A:** Pay $400–$600/month out-of-pocket for therapy during 6-month remaining wait. Total: $2,400–$3,600 out-of-pocket plus $3,000 premiums = $5,400–$6,600 first year.
- **Option B:** Go without therapy during remaining 6 months. Save $2,400, but untreated depression worsens. By month 8, she's barely functional. Takes 6 months of therapy post-wait to stabilize. Total lost productivity: ~6 months of career stagnation, relationship strain, potentially worse mental health.
- **Option C:** Switch to ACA ($600/month) for immediate therapy coverage. Cost: $7,200/year but with actual treatment from day 1.

The financial math on Option B is attractive short-term ($3,000 premiums vs. $7,200 ACA) until you factor the **value of untreated depression**: lost income, damaged relationships, worse long-term outcomes.

This is the calculus health sharing marketing never mentions.

## The Chronic Condition Trap

Waiting periods make health sharing mathematical malpractice for chronic conditions.

**Scenario: 50-year-old with Type 2 diabetes**

Year 1 costs with Medi-Share (12-month wait):
- Premiums: $3,600
- Insulin (monthly): $300 × 12 = $3,600
- Glucose monitoring supplies: $50 × 12 = $600
- Quarterly endocrinology visits (out-of-pocket): $200 × 4 = $800
- Lab work (A1C testing): $200
- **Total: $8,800**

Compare ACA Silver Plan:
- Premiums: $6,000
- Deductible: $500
- Coinsurance (after deductible, 20%): ~$1,500 (estimated on $7,500 in care)
- **Total: $8,000**

Same price, but ACA covers diabetes from day 1. With Medi-Share, during that 12-month wait, you're paying 100% of diabetes management while the organization covers nothing. Any endocrine complication (kidney disease, neuropathy, retinopathy) that develops during the wait? You missed the early intervention window.

The outcome cost of missed early intervention (later kidney transplant, worse vision loss) could be $50,000–$200,000 over 10 years.

**The hidden cost:** Delayed intervention on chronic disease costs more long-term than the monthly premium difference.

## The Mental Health Crater

Health sharing's mental health coverage doesn't just have gaps—it has chasms.

Most plans:
- Psychiatric medication: $10–$50 copay (covered)
- Therapy: $0 coverage (excluded)

Real cost of mental health in America:
- Weekly therapy: $100–$150/session = $5,000–$7,500/year
- Psychiatric medication + management: $1,000–$2,000/year
- Crisis/inpatient care (if needed): $5,000–$15,000

With health sharing, you pay:
- Medication copay (covered): $100–$200/year
- Therapy (not covered): $5,000–$7,500/year (out-of-pocket)
- Crisis care (covered): $500–$2,000 (member responsibility)
- **Real cost: $5,600–$9,700/year**

With ACA, you pay:
- Medication copay: $100–$200/year
- Therapy copay: $500–$2,000/year (25–50 visits at $10–$40 copay)
- Crisis care: $500–$2,000
- **Real cost: $1,100–$4,200/year** (plus premiums, offset by subsidies)

The hidden cost: Mental health untreated or under-treated ($5,000/year out-of-pocket), causing:
- Missed work days (productivity loss)
- Damaged relationships
- Medication non-compliance
- Eventual crisis that costs thousands

One study found untreated depression costs employers $1,685 per employee annually in lost productivity. For individuals, it's incalculable.

## The Claim Uncertainty Cost

Insurance has legal obligations. Health sharing doesn't.

**Real scenario: $80,000 cancer claim**

With insurance:
- Plan covers 80% after deductible
- Your out-of-pocket max: $8,700 (legally capped)
- You know this before treatment

With health sharing:
- Organization covers "based on fund availability"
- Could be 80%, could be 50%, could be deferred if fund depleted
- No legal limit on your responsibility
- You don't know until month 3 of treatment

The hidden cost of this uncertainty: stress, delayed treatment, financial planning paralysis.

Some people delay starting chemotherapy while waiting to confirm health sharing will cover. Days matter in cancer treatment. That delay—caused by the uncertainty of informal coverage—could have clinical consequences worth thousands or worse.

---

## The Faith Requirement Cost

For non-religious or LGBTQ+ members using faith-based plans:

Samaritan, CHM, and strict Medi-Share implementations ask members to affirm Christian values and follow lifestyle guidelines.

Hidden cost:
- Moral discomfort (paying monthly while ethics misaligned)
- Fear of rejection if lifestyle is discovered
- Potential for claim denial based on lifestyle judgment

One member told me she paid 14 months of Samaritan membership before discovering same-sex relationships were considered a violation. She switched to Zion and felt relief—not financial, but moral. That relief has a value that health sharing marketing never captures.

## The Comparison Nobody Makes: Real Cost vs. ACA

Most people compare advertised health sharing premiums ($225/mo) to ACA premiums ($450/mo) and conclude health sharing wins 50% on cost.

But compare **real total cost**:

**Health sharing true annual cost:**
- Premiums: $2,700
- Annual share: $750
- Copays/user fees: $500
- Member responsibility (estimated): $1,000
- **Total: $4,950** (excludes pre-existing wait periods)

**ACA true annual cost** (before subsidies):
- Premiums: $5,400
- Deductible: $500
- Copays/coinsurance (estimated): $1,000
- **Total: $6,900**

Savings: ~$2,000/year (29%, not 50%)

And that assumes no major medical event (where health sharing's coverage gaps explode) and no pre-existing conditions (where waiting periods make health sharing unaffordable).

**The hidden cost:** Advertised savings are overstated. Real savings are 20–30%, not 40–60%.

---

## What Isn't Hidden: The Legal Vulnerability

Health sharing plans can deny claims, defer payments indefinitely, or even terminate membership with minimal explanation or recourse.

This isn't hidden—it's in the contract. But it's so buried in fine print that members don't absorb it until they need to use it.

Real cost: The peace-of-mind premium you're not paying. With insurance, you can budget for known out-of-pocket maximums. With health sharing, you can't.

## The Bottom Line: What Health Sharing Actually Costs

**For healthy young people (no pre-existing):**
- Real cost: $3,000–$5,000/year
- Savings vs. ACA: $2,000–$3,000/year (legitimate savings)
- Hidden costs: Minimal

**For people with pre-existing conditions:**
- Real cost Year 1: $6,000–$10,000 (premiums + out-of-pocket during wait)
- Real cost Year 2+: $3,500–$5,000 (covered, but member responsibility %s add up)
- Hidden costs: Missed early intervention, disease progression during wait
- Savings vs. ACA: Questionable (breaks even at month 18+)

**For people needing mental health:**
- Real cost: $5,000–$10,000/year (out-of-pocket therapy)
- Savings vs. ACA: Negative (cost more, less coverage)
- Hidden costs: Untreated mental illness progression

**For self-employed (tax deduction benefit):**
- Effective cost: $1,500–$3,000/year (after 35–40% tax savings)
- Savings vs. ACA: $3,000–$5,000/year (legitimate)
- Hidden costs: Minimal if healthy

Health sharing's true cost depends entirely on your health status. It's cheap for healthy people and dangerous for sick people. The cost difference is hidden in waiting periods, coverage gaps, and unquantified outcomes.

The marketing says "$225/month." The reality is far more complex.

**As of February 2026.** Most hidden costs only become apparent after major medical events. By then, it's too late to switch.
