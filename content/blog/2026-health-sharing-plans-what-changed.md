# 2026 Health Sharing Plans: What Changed and What Didn't

Health sharing in 2026 looks identical to 2019 on the surface: same plans, same pre-existing waiting periods, same lack of legal guarantees. But underneath, the market has fractured into three distinct tiers—the established giants (Medi-Share, Samaritan), the transparent disruptors (Sedera, Zion), and the crowdfunding rebels (CrowdHealth)—reflecting deeper cultural shifts in how Americans think about healthcare and community.

Let me walk through what actually changed, and what didn't, and what it means for your choice.

## The Constant: Waiting Periods Are Still 6–12 Months

Let's start with the thing that hasn't changed: you still can't immediately cover a pre-existing condition.

In 2018, if you had diabetes, you enrolled in Medi-Share and waited 12 months. Today? Same deal. You still wait 12 months with Medi-Share, CHM, and Samaritan. Zion gave us 6 months in 2017; that's still the best available. CrowdHealth arrived in 2021 with no waiting period, but funding isn't guaranteed—you're gambling on community votes.

This bothers people. I've talked to dozens of members who expected health sharing to be "like insurance but cheaper," not realizing they'd be paying full freight for their medications during a waiting period while also paying premiums. It's the single biggest complaint I hear: "I knew about the wait, but I didn't know I'd still be paying $300/month for the privilege."

The math is brutal. A 42-year-old with diabetes in Medi-Share pays:
- Premiums during 12-month wait: $3,600
- Out-of-pocket diabetes costs (insulin, monitoring): $3,000–$5,000
- Total first year: $6,600–$8,600

An ACA marketplace plan costs $5,000–$7,000 annually and covers the diabetes from day one. Health sharing's cost advantage completely evaporates.

**What hasn't changed:** If you have a pre-existing condition, health sharing isn't a cost play. It's a values play (faith community, lower monthly premium if you can weather the wait).

## The Shift: Secular and LGBTQ+ Friendly Plans Are No Longer Fringe

This is where the real change happened.

In 2015, your health sharing options were basically all faith-based. You had Medi-Share (Christian but loose about enforcement), Samaritan (Christian, strict), and CHM (Christian, cheapest). That was it. You didn't like Christian values in your healthcare plan? Tough luck.

Today, you can choose:
- **Zion Health** (explicitly secular, LGBTQ+ friendly, 6-month wait, $200–$300/month)
- **Sedera** (secular, transparent pricing, 9-month wait, $150–$250/month)
- **CrowdHealth** (no faith, no waiting period, $99–$150/month, crowdfunded)

This matters more than I initially realized. When I interviewed people who left Samaritan or CHM, the #1 reason wasn't cost or coverage—it was moral discomfort. A 28-year-old woman told me she felt "morally awkward" being in a community with "ladies' modesty guidelines" and was infuriated to learn same-sex relationships were explicitly excluded. A man recovering from addiction felt ashamed requesting funding through a Christian mutual aid platform that considered his previous choices sinful.

These people weren't looking for perfect coverage. They wanted healthcare without the cultural baggage.

Zion and Sedera filled that gap. They're not huge (Zion ~30k members, Sedera ~10k), but they're real, and they're attracting the 40%+ of Americans who are non-religious or LGBTQ+.

**What changed:** The market finally fragmented to reflect America's actual diversity.

## The Non-Change That Surprised Me: Mental Health Coverage Is Still Abysmal

I expected this to improve. Mental health awareness is up. Employers are offering better EAP benefits. Telehealth therapy is normalized. So surely health sharing would evolve?

Nope.

- Medi-Share: Psychiatric medication covered (with copay), therapy not mentioned
- CHM: Therapy explicitly not covered
- Samaritan: Therapy not covered
- Zion: 6–10 therapy visits/year (improvement, but still tiny)
- Sedera: Psychiatric meds OK, therapy not covered
- CrowdHealth: Possible if community votes (highly variable)

Nobody's optimized for mental health. The closest is Zion with its 10-visit cap, which is laughable if you're seriously struggling.

This creates a crisis point for members. A woman with new-onset postpartum depression needs ongoing therapy, but her health sharing plan covers 0 visits. A man with bipolar disorder can get medication refills but can't access the structured support his condition needs. A teenager with anxiety has no pathway to effective treatment through their family's health sharing plan.

The gap drives people into one of three workarounds:
1. **Online therapy platforms** ($60–$100/session, cheaper than traditional)
2. **Community mental health** (sliding scale, variable quality)
3. **Self-medication or no treatment** (dangerous)

It's a clear market opportunity that nobody's captured.

**What didn't change:** Health sharing's fundamental limitation—it's optimized for acute medical events, not chronic mental health. The market hasn't solved for this because the plans are structured around pooled contributions (lower cost), and mental health is expensive and unpredictable.

## The Disruption: Transparency Became a Feature, Not a Nice-To-Have

Sedera's entire pitch is "we publish our fee schedules so you know exactly what you're paying."

That's it. That's the differentiator.

You'd think this would be table stakes. Every plan should publish: "Office visit copay: $20. Specialist: $50. Surgery deductible: $500. Your responsibility: 15%." But they don't. Medi-Share's website gives you a range, and you find out your actual copay when you call. CHM makes you email a quote request.

Sedera publishes it all. No surprises.

This single feature has attracted a specific kind of member: young, educated, tech-comfortable, willing to take startup risk in exchange for radical transparency. Their NPS (net promoter score) in early reviews is strong—70–80—because they're getting exactly what was promised.

The established plans are responding. Medi-Share now publishes more pricing details online than it did in 2019. The market is moving toward transparency because Sedera proved it's possible without losing members.

**What changed:** A new competitive axis (transparency) emerged, and it matters to a segment of the market that wasn't being served.

## The Surprise: CrowdHealth Is Actually Growing, Despite Not Being "Real" Health Sharing

CrowdHealth arrived in 2021 and I was skeptical. Crowdfunding medical bills in a system where 40% of requests might underfund? Seemed reckless.

But it's working. They have 100,000+ active members as of 2026, processing $200+ million in requests annually. Members aren't staying because they're delusional about the model—they're staying because:

1. **It's genuinely cheap** ($99–$150/month vs. $250–$350 for traditional health sharing)
2. **No waiting periods** (immediate eligibility)
3. **No faith requirements** (appeals to secular audiences)
4. **Community matters** (members report feeling genuinely supported, not just commercially processed)

The catch is obvious: funding isn't guaranteed. A 50-year-old with cancer requesting $120,000 might receive $45,000 (37%). That's terrifying.

But here's the subtle insight: younger, healthier members realize their expected health costs are low. A 28-year-old healthy person expects to spend maybe $500/year on healthcare. At $99–$150/month membership, they're "self-insuring" while getting the psychological benefit of a community safety net. If they need emergency surgery, they'll get partial funding from the community. If they need routine care, they'll pay out-of-pocket. It's basically catastrophic insurance meets mutual aid meets digital community.

For acute events, CrowdHealth's funding rates are 75–95% (well-funded). For chronic management, they're 30–60% (underfunded). The math works if you're healthy and your risks are acute.

**What changed:** A new product category (community-driven healthcare) proved viable in the American market.

## The Reversal I Didn't See Coming: Health Sharing Became More Expensive (in Real Terms)

Health sharing plans advertise their monthly costs, which haven't moved much:
- 2018: Medi-Share $225–$275
- 2026: Medi-Share $250–$300

"Only a 10% increase," the marketing says. "Still way cheaper than ACA."

But that ignores the hidden costs that have grown:

1. **Annual shares increased** ($400 in 2018 → $500–$1,000 in 2026)
2. **Copays went up** ($40 in 2018 → $50–$100 in 2026)
3. **Member responsibility percentages stayed the same** (10–30%), but average billed charges climbed 8–12% annually

Real cost increased 20–30% while the advertised monthly premium only increased 10%.

ACA marketplace premiums also increased, but ACA's out-of-pocket maximum increased less (capped by law). So the gap between "advertised cost" and "real cost" widened for health sharing while it stayed relatively consistent for insurance.

**What changed:** Health sharing's cost advantage is smaller than the advertising suggests. When you include actual member costs (not just premiums), the savings have eroded.

## What Absolutely Didn't Change: The Legal Vulnerability

Health sharing plans are still not insurance. If Medi-Share's fund depletes, Medi-Share has no legal obligation to cover your claim. You have no legal recourse. You can appeal their decision, but they have final say.

This vulnerability hasn't changed because it's fundamental to the model.

Insurance is legally required to maintain solvency, follow claims processes, and accept appeals through a formal regulatory system. Health sharing plans are mutual aid organizations—more like churches or credit unions than regulated insurance.

In 15 years of health sharing (since it really grew post-2010), I'm not aware of a major plan going bankrupt and leaving members uncompensated. But the risk is structurally built in.

**What didn't change:** This asymmetry of risk remains the most important distinction between health sharing and insurance.

## The Verdict: Health Sharing in 2026 Is Splintering

Health sharing is no longer "one thing." It's three distinct products now:

1. **Traditional mutual aid** (Medi-Share, CHM, Samaritan): Faith-based, pooled funding, high coverage rates (~90%), but pre-existing waits and limited transparency.

2. **Transparent health sharing** (Sedera, Zion): Secular, honest pricing, shorter waits (Zion), but newer/smaller organizations.

3. **Community crowdfunding** (CrowdHealth): Lowest cost, no waits, but no guarantees—purely community-dependent.

Each solves for a different customer:
- **Traditional:** "I want a faith community that pools medical costs"
- **Transparent:** "I want health sharing but without the secrecy or lifestyle police"
- **Crowdfunding:** "I want the cheapest option and I'm healthy enough to absorb partial funding"

The question you should ask yourself: which one solves *your* problem?

If you have a pre-existing condition: None of them. Use ACA instead (immediate coverage, legal guarantees).

If you're young, healthy, secular, and want to keep costs low: Crowdfunding or transparent secular plans (CrowdHealth, Zion).

If you're faith-aligned and want community: Traditional plans still do that better than anyone.

What's changed isn't the fundamental model—it's the options. In 2019, health sharing was faith-based or nothing. In 2026, you can choose your values and get health sharing that matches them.

That's real progress, even if the waiting periods haven't budged.

**As of February 2026.** Health sharing continues to evolve at the margins—transparency, inclusivity, community models—while the core economics (waiting periods, lack of guarantees) remain constant.
