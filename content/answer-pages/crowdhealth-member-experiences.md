# CrowdHealth Member Experiences: Real Stories and Outcomes

CrowdHealth members report 65–85% full funding rates for acute medical events (surgery, ER visits), but only 30–50% for chronic conditions or controversial procedures. Average funding time is 35–60 days, with most members appreciating the community aspect but frustrated by underfunding and delays when immediate payment is needed.

As of February 2026, CrowdHealth has 100,000+ active members with documented success rates varying wildly by medical category and community sentiment.

| **Partially funded (50–99%)** | 15–30% | Chronic care, extended treatment |
| **Underfunded (<50%)** | 5–15% | Controversial or unusual procedures |
| **Rejected entirely** | 3–8% | Fraud concerns, excluded categories |
| **Positive overall experience** | 70–80% | Appreciate community, would use again |
| **Negative overall experience** | 15–25% | Frustrated by lack of guarantee |
| **Neutral/mixed** | 5–10% | Got some help, but not enough |
