# Health Sharing vs. ACA Marketplace: Cost, Coverage, and When Each Is Better

ACA marketplace insurance costs $300–$700/month for individuals with legal coverage guarantees, preventive care at 100%, and pre-existing condition coverage from day 1. Health sharing costs $150–$350/month but excludes pre-existing for 6–12 months and coverage is not legally guaranteed. For families with pre-existing conditions, ACA is cheaper in true costs; for healthy young people, health sharing saves $2,000–$3,000 annually.

As of February 2026, ACA marketplace remains the default choice for anyone with a pre-existing condition, while health sharing only makes financial sense for the healthy self-employed or young uninsured.

## Direct Cost Comparison

| Scenario | ACA Marketplace | Health Sharing | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Healthy 28-year-old** | $400–$600/mo = $4,800–$7,200/yr | $225/mo = $2,700/yr | ✓ Health sharing (saves $2,000–$4,500) |
| **Diabetic 45-year-old** | $600–$900/mo = $7,200–$10,800/yr (covered) | $3,000/yr premiums + $3,000/yr out-of-pocket during wait | ✓ ACA (guaranteed coverage, same total cost) |
| **Pregnant person** | $600–$900/mo = $7,200–$10,800/yr (covered day 1) | $2,700/yr premiums + $8,000–$15,000 self-pay delivery | ✓ ACA (avoids self-pay delivery) |
| **Self-employed, $80k income** | $4,800/yr premiums (after tax credit) | $2,700/yr premiums – $648 tax deduction = $2,052 effective | ✓ Health sharing (tax deduction saves 40%) |
| **Low income <$30k** | $0–$200/mo (full subsidies) or Medicaid | $200–$350/mo (too expensive) | ✓ ACA/Medicaid (affordability) |
| **Family, no pre-existing** | $12,000–$18,000/yr | $3,600–$5,400/yr | ✓ Health sharing (33–50% savings) |

## Cost If One Major Event Occurs (Cancer Diagnosis, Year 5)

**ACA Marketplace:**
- Premiums (5 years): $25,500
- Deductible & coinsurance (cancer treatment): $7,000
- Chemotherapy/surgery/radiation: $150,000 (80% covered by insurance)
- **Remaining 20% (out-of-pocket cap): $8,700**
- **Total 5-year cost: $41,200** (legally protected from bankruptcy)

**Health Sharing:**
- Premiums (5 years): $13,500
- Annual share (5 years): $2,500
- Cancer diagnosed (pre-existing): 12-month exclusion = $0 coverage, pay 100%

- Post-exclusion: Covered at 80%
- **Total 5-year cost: $13,500 + $2,500 + $150,000 = $166,000** (or bankruptcy)

## Tax Implications

**ACA Marketplace:**
- Employer-subsidized premiums (if applicable): Pre-tax (no tax)
- Individual purchases: Post-tax (no deduction unless self-employed)
- Subsidies: Advance tax credits (may owe back if income changes)

**Health Sharing (self-employed):**
- Premiums: Schedule C deduction (100% deductible)
- Tax savings: 24% bracket + 15.3% self-employment tax = ~39% savings
- Effective cost: $225 premium × (1 – 0.39) = $137 after tax savings

**Winner for self-employed: Health sharing** (taxes make it 35–40% cheaper than ACA for 24%+ tax bracket)

## The Pre-Existing Condition Game-Changer

**If you have ANY pre-existing condition, ACA is the only rational choice.**

**Pre-existing definition (health sharing):**
- Any condition diagnosed before enrollment
- Diabetes, heart disease, asthma, depression, arthritis, etc.
- 6–12 month waiting period (varies by plan)

**Real cost during waiting period:**
- Medi-Share example: $225/month ($2,700/year) + $3,000–$5,000 out-of-pocket medical costs
- ACA example: $600/month ($7,200/year) but all medical covered immediately
- **Breakeven: ~Year 2, but ACA provides coverage certainty year 1**

**Verdict:** For pre-existing conditions, ACA's guaranteed coverage saves stress and money.

## Medicaid: The Hidden Winner for Low Income

If earning <138% of Federal Poverty Level (varies by state):

**Medicaid:** $0 premium, covers everything (if state expanded)  
**ACA:** $0 premium + subsidies (some states)  
**Health sharing:** $200–$350/month (unaffordable for low-income)

**Winner: Medicaid expansion states** (zero cost coverage)

## Special Situations

### If Pregnant (or Planning Pregnancy)

- **ACA:** Enroll immediately; covers pregnancy day 1; delivery fully covered
- **Health sharing:** 9–12 month maternity waiting period; must plan 12 months ahead
- **Verdict:** ACA if pregnant now; health sharing if planning 12+ months ahead

### If Planning Major Surgery

- **ACA:** Schedule anytime; covered after enrollment
- **Health sharing:** Plan 12+ months ahead to avoid pre-existing waiting period
- **Verdict:** ACA for flexibility

### If Unemployed/Between Jobs

- **ACA:** Can enroll with qualifying life event (job loss); may get subsidies
- **Health sharing:** No job-loss special enrollment; must enroll immediately
- **Verdict:** ACA for job-loss protection

### If Self-Employed with High Income ($150k+)

- **ACA:** Fewer subsidies available; pay higher premiums
- **Health sharing:** Tax deduction saves significantly; monthly cost effectively 60% of ACA
- **Verdict:** Health sharing (tax savings huge at high income)

## FAQ

**Can I switch from ACA to health sharing mid-year?**

Yes, but there's no penalty. If you enroll in ACA (qualifying life event), you can switch to health sharing the next month. Pre-existing waiting periods restart on new plan.

**Does ACA cover health sharing premiums?**

No. If you have ACA, you don't enroll in health sharing simultaneously. They're mutually exclusive.

**What if I choose health sharing and regret it?**

You can switch to ACA during open enrollment (Nov–Jan) or if you have a qualifying life event (birth, marriage, job loss, move). But you'll restart pre-existing waiting periods on the new plan.

**Is there a penalty for not having coverage?**

ACA mandate penalty is $0 as of 2026. So technically no penalty whether you choose ACA, health sharing, or nothing. But that can change with legislation.

**As of February 2026.** Compare all three: ACA, health sharing, and Medicaid before deciding. True cost depends on your health status, income, and risk tolerance.
