# Best Health Sharing Plans with No Faith Requirement: Secular Options 2026

Three health sharing plans explicitly don't require faith alignment: Zion Health, Sedera, and CrowdHealth. Zion Health ($175–$300/month) and Sedera ($150–$220/month) are traditional health sharing models without religious affiliation. CrowdHealth ($99–$150/month) is a modern crowdfunding alternative with no faith component.

As of February 2026, secular health sharing is the fastest-growing segment as non-religious Americans seek affordable healthcare without lifestyle restrictions.

## The Three Secular Options

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Pre-Existing Wait | Coverage Model | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Zion Health** | $175–$300 | 6 months | Traditional sharing | Secular families, no faith requirement |
| **Sedera** | $150–$220 | 9 months | Traditional sharing, high transparency | Tech-savvy, want visibility |
| **CrowdHealth** | $99–$150 | None | Crowdfunding, modern model | Young, healthy, tech-native |

## Why Most Health Sharing Is Faith-Based

Historically, health sharing originated in religious communities:

- **Medi-Share** (1992): Mennonite Church foundation
- **Samaritan Ministries** (1994): Christian community model
- **CHM** (1984): Christian Health Ministry

These plans have lifestyle requirements (no smoking, no drinking, no premarital relations) tied to faith values. Most require explicit faith commitment.

**Zion, Sedera, and CrowdHealth emerged to serve the secular market** (50%+ of Americans).

## FAQ

**Can I use Zion/Sedera/CrowdHealth if I'm agnostic or atheist?**

Yes. These plans have zero faith requirements. They don't discriminate based on religion or lack thereof. Explicitly LGBTQ+ and secular-friendly.

**Which secular option is most stable?**

Zion Health (founded 2015) has longest track record. Sedera (2019) is newer but transparent. CrowdHealth (2021) is startup with highest risk.

**Can I combine Sedera with other coverage?**

You can use Sedera + HSA (if HDHP-compliant plan chosen) for tax advantages. Don't combine with other primary coverage.
