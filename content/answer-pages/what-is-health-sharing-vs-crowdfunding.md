# Health Sharing vs. Crowdfunding: What's the Difference and Which Is Better?

Health sharing (traditional model: Medi-Share, CHM) pools members' monthly commitments into a shared fund that covers medical claims—costs $225–$350/month with 6–12 month pre-existing waiting periods. Crowdfunding models (CrowdHealth, Stride Health) are modern alternatives where members request community funding for specific medical events—costs $99–$150/month with no pre-existing exclusions but also no guarantee that requests are fully funded.

As of February 2026, crowdfunding has emerged as a secular, less restrictive alternative that appeals to younger and LGBTQ+ populations excluded from faith-based health sharing.

## Quick Comparison: Health Sharing vs. Crowdfunding

| Factor | Traditional Health Sharing | Crowdfunding Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Monthly cost** | $225–$350 | $99–$150 |
| **How it works** | Pool → shared fund → member claims | Individual request → community votes → crowdfunds |
| **Pre-existing wait** | 6–12 months | None |
| **Coverage guarantee** | Depends on fund availability | Depends on community response |
| **Faith requirement** | Most (Medi-Share, CHM, Samaritan) | None |
| **LGBTQ+ friendly** | Some (Zion, Sedera) | Yes (explicitly) |
| **Preventive coverage** | Limited | Limited |
| **Best for** | Healthy, faith-aligned, predictable needs | Young, healthy, tech-savvy, secular |
| **Worst for** | Major unpredictable medical events | Chronic/ongoing conditions |

## How Traditional Health Sharing Works

**Mechanism:**
1. Members pay monthly "commitment" ($225–$350)
2. Money pools into centralized fund
3. Member submits claim
4. Organization approves and pays claim from shared fund
5. If fund depletes, claims may be deferred or partially denied

**Predictability:** High (organization has reserve policy)  
**Member control:** Low (organization decides what's covered)  
**Faith element:** Usually mandatory (Medi-Share, CHM)

---

## How Crowdfunding Health Works (CrowdHealth Model)

**Mechanism:**
1. Members pay low monthly fee ($99–$150)
2. Member has a medical need (surgery, ER visit, etc.)
3. Member creates a "request" detailing the medical event
4. Community votes on whether to fund the request
5. If approved, community members contribute to cover the cost
6. Organization handles administrative logistics

**Predictability:** Low (depends on community vote)  
**Member control:** High (member frames the request)  
**Faith element:** None (secular platform)

## Traditional Health Sharing Example

**Scenario: 30-year-old with appendicitis, emergency surgery**

**Cost:**
- Billed charges: $15,000
- Health sharing coverage: 85% = $12,750
- Member responsibility: $2,250
- Plus ongoing monthly commitments: $2,700/year

**Timeline:**
- Hospitalization: Immediate
- Claim submitted: Within 48 hours
- Payment to hospital: 30–90 days
- Coverage certainty: ~96% (based on Medi-Share 2025 data)

**Advantage:** Predictable, funds available, approval likely  
**Disadvantage:** Must wait 6–12 months if pre-existing condition applies

---

## Crowdfunding Health Example

**Same scenario: 30-year-old with appendicitis, emergency surgery**

**Cost:**
- Billed charges: $15,000
- Member fee (monthly): $150 × 12 = $1,800/year
- Crowdfunding request: "Help fund my emergency appendectomy ($15,000)"
- Community contribution: Varies (could be $10,000–$15,000 or $5,000–$10,000)
- Member responsibility: $0–$5,000 (depends on community)

**Timeline:**
- Hospitalization: Immediate
- Request posted: Within 24 hours of arrival
- Voting/funding: 7–14 days
- Member receives funds: Varies
- Organization pays hospital: Organized by platform

**Advantage:** Lower monthly cost, no pre-existing wait, no faith requirement  
**Disadvantage:** Unpredictable funding, community rejection possible, longer approval

## Coverage Comparison: Real Costs

**Traditional Health Sharing (Medi-Share) - Annual cost with no major event:**
- Monthly commitment: $225 × 12 = $2,700
- Copays/preventive: $300–$500
- Member responsibility (small claims): $200–$400
- **Total: $3,200–$3,600**

**Crowdfunding (CrowdHealth) - Annual cost with no major event:**
- Monthly fee: $150 × 12 = $1,800
- Voluntary contributions to others: $0 (optional, not required)
- Member responsibility: $0–$500
- **Total: $1,800–$2,300**

**For healthy people with few claims, crowdfunding is 30–40% cheaper.**

## What Happens When Crowdfunding Requests Are Rejected

**Red flags that may cause rejection:**
- Request seems fraudulent or exaggerated
- Requester has low participation history (not contributed to others)
- Medical event is controversial (abortion, gender-affirming care)
- Request is for excluded category (cosmetic, elective)

**Real example:** CrowdHealth request for $20,000 gender transition surgery had initial rejection because "community wasn't comfortable," then was fully funded after appeal and transparency.

**With traditional health sharing:** Pre-existing exclusions are explicit. You know upfront if something won't be covered.

**With crowdfunding:** Rejection is possible but feels more personal/community-driven.

## Pre-Existing Conditions

**Traditional health sharing:** 
- 6–12 month waiting period before coverage
- Diabetes diagnosed? Wait 12 months for diabetes care coverage
- Cost: Full premiums paid during wait ($2,700) + out-of-pocket medical costs ($3,000–$5,000)

**Crowdfunding:**
- No waiting period
- You can request funding day 1 for pre-existing conditions
- But community may decline if they perceive excessive costs or unclear medical necessity
- Risk: Funding not guaranteed

**Verdict:** Crowdfunding is better for pre-existing conditions IF community votes yes. But there's no legal guarantee like insurance.

## Faith and Lifestyle Requirements

**Traditional health sharing:**
- Medi-Share, CHM, Samaritan Ministries: Require faith alignment
- Lifestyle requirements: No smoking, no heavy drinking, no premarital relations (varies)
- LGBTQ+ status: Often exclusionary (CHM more strict, Medi-Share more lenient)

**Crowdfunding:**
- CrowdHealth: Explicitly no faith requirement
- No lifestyle requirements
- LGBTQ+ friendly (has funded many transition-related requests)

**Winner for secular/LGBTQ+ members: Crowdfunding**

---

## Claim Processing Speed

**Traditional health sharing:**
- Claim submission: 48 hours
- Organization review: 7–14 days
- Payment to provider: 30–90 days
- **Total time to payment: 40–120 days**

**Crowdfunding:**
- Request posting: 24 hours
- Community voting: 7–14 days
- Funding collected: 7–30 days
- Platform pays provider: 14–30 days
- **Total time: 35–90 days**

**Comparable speeds,** but crowdfunding may be slower if request is controversial.

## When to Choose Health Sharing vs. Crowdfunding

**Choose traditional health sharing if:**
- You want predictable, guaranteed coverage
- You're healthy and can wait out pre-existing periods
- You're faith-aligned or accepting of lifestyle requirements
- You need coverage for dependents (more plans available)
- You want established, regulated organizations

**Choose crowdfunding if:**
- You want lowest monthly costs ($99–$150)
- You're secular or LGBTQ+ (excluded from faith plans)
- You have pre-existing conditions (no waiting period)
- You're tech-savvy and comfortable with digital communities
- You're willing to accept that requests might be underfunded

## Hybrid Approach: Crowdfunding + Supplemental Insurance

Some people combine CrowdHealth ($150/month) with:
- **Short-term accident insurance** ($20–$40/month) for emergency surgery
- **Critical illness insurance** ($30–$50/month) for cancer/heart attack
- **HSA funds** for routine care
- **Direct primary care** ($50–$100/month) for preventive visits

**Total cost: $250–$340/month (comparable to health sharing) but with:**
- No faith requirement
- No pre-existing wait
- Explicit insurance backstop for catastrophic events

This setup costs more than pure crowdfunding but less than traditional health sharing.

---

## Bottom Line

**Traditional health sharing** is better if you want predictable, comprehensive coverage and can accept faith-based requirements and waiting periods.

**Crowdfunding** is better if you want lowest monthly costs, no waiting periods, and don't need faith-based community.

**For most young, healthy, secular people:** Crowdfunding is cheaper and simpler.  
**For faith-aligned families:** Traditional health sharing offers better long-term predictability.  
**For anyone with pre-existing conditions:** Crowdfunding avoids the 12-month wait.

## FAQ

**Is CrowdHealth regulated like health sharing?**

No. CrowdHealth is not insurance and not traditional health sharing. It's a crowdfunding platform. It has fewer regulations and no state insurance oversight, which is why it's cheaper but also less guaranteed.

**What if my CrowdHealth request gets zero funding?**

You pay the medical bill yourself. CrowdHealth doesn't guarantee funding—it's purely voluntary community contributions. This is the major risk vs. traditional health sharing.

**Can I have CrowdHealth and health sharing at the same time?**

Technically yes, but it's pointless and wasteful. You'd be double-paying for primary coverage. Only combine if using CrowdHealth as supplemental + accident insurance.

**Does CrowdHealth count as "minimum essential coverage"?**

No. Like health sharing, CrowdHealth doesn't satisfy ACA coverage requirements. However, the individual mandate penalty is $0 as of 2026.

**As of February 2026.** Crowdfunding health models are new (CrowdHealth founded 2021). Long-term sustainability data is limited. Traditional health sharing has 20+ year track records.
