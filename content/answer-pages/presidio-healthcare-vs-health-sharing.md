# Presidio Healthcare vs. Health Sharing: Insurance vs. Sharing Model

Presidio Healthcare is a licensed health insurance plan (small business/individual market) offering low-cost coverage for $200–$400/month with $0 deductible options, covering pre-existing conditions immediately. Health sharing costs $225–$350/month but excludes pre-existing for 6–12 months and doesn't legally guarantee coverage, making Presidio the safer choice for families with health conditions.

As of February 2026, Presidio is emerging as the "ACA alternative" for those seeking licensed insurance protection at near-health-sharing prices.

## Cost Comparison: Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Young, Healthy Individual (age 28)

**Presidio Healthcare (basic plan):**
- Monthly premium: $220
- Deductible: $500
- Annual cost (no claims): $2,640
- Annual cost (one ER visit $2,000): $2,640 + $500 = $3,140

**Medi-Share Health Sharing:**
- Monthly commitment: $225
- Annual share: $500
- Annual cost (no claims): $2,700 + $500 = $3,200
- Annual cost (one ER visit $2,000): $3,200 + $200 (member responsibility) = $3,400

**Verdict:** Essentially tied. Presidio slightly better (legal guarantee).

### Scenario 2: Adult with Diabetes (age 42)

**Presidio Healthcare:**
- Monthly premium: $380
- Deductible: $500
- Annual medication cost: $1,500 (insulin, supplies)
- Coinsurance (after deductible): 20% = $300
- **Total annual cost: $4,560 + $300 = $4,860**

**Medi-Share Health Sharing:**
- Monthly commitment: $300
- Annual share: $1,000 (higher due to age/condition)
- Pre-existing waiting period: 12 months
- Cost during wait: $3,600 + $1,500 (medication) + supplies = $5,100
- Cost after wait: $3,600 + $300 (copays) + $500 (insulin copay) = $4,400
- **Total year 1 cost: $5,100** (full cost during exclusion)
- **Cost year 2+: $4,400** (after exclusion ends)

**Verdict:** Presidio wins year 1 ($4,860 with coverage vs. $5,100 no coverage). After year 2, costs are similar, but Presidio has coverage certainty.

### Scenario 3: Family with Pre-Existing (Parent + 2 kids, one with asthma)

**Presidio Healthcare (family plan):**
- Monthly premium: $650
- Deductible (family): $1,500
- Annual cost (no major events): $7,800
- Child's asthma medication copay: $20/month = $240/year
- **Total: $8,040**

**Medi-Share Health Sharing:**
- Monthly commitment (family): $325
- Annual share: $1,000
- Pre-existing wait: 12 months for child's asthma
- Year 1 cost (asthma excluded): $3,900 + $2,400 (asthma medication out-of-pocket) + $1,000 = $7,300
- Year 2+ cost (asthma covered): $3,900 + $240 (copay) + hospitalization coverage = $4,140+
- **Year 1 total: $7,300** (but asthma not covered)
- **Year 2+ total: $4,140+** (with coverage)

**Verdict:** Presidio ($8,040) slightly higher year 1 but guaranteed coverage. Health sharing year 1 ($7,300) underfunded during asthma exclusion. Year 2+, health sharing cheaper but child had no coverage during critical year 1.

## When to Choose Presidio (Insurance)

**Choose Presidio if:**
- You have pre-existing chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, asthma)
- You need immediate preventive care (cancer screening, annual exam)
- You require mental health services
- You want legal claim protections
- You have dependents with chronic conditions
- You need pregnancy coverage immediately (no waiting period)
- You value predictability and guarantees
- You earn too much for Medicaid but want comprehensive coverage

---

## When to Choose Health Sharing

**Choose health sharing if:**
- You're young, healthy, and have no pre-existing conditions
- You're faith-aligned and want community aspect
- You're self-employed and want Schedule C deduction (saves 15–40% tax)
- You can afford to wait 6–12 months for pre-existing coverage
- You value lowest possible monthly cost
- You're willing to accept informal coverage model
- You have very high income (don't need subsidies)

---

## Presidio Financial Stability

**Concerns:**
- Newer company (founded 2019, relatively small)
- Less established than major insurers (UnitedHealth, Aetna)
- Operates in limited states (check availability)
- Venture-backed (startup model)

**Assurances:**
- State-licensed (meaning regulators oversee solvency)
- Reinsurance arrangements (protection if claims exceed reserves)
- No major solvency concerns reported (2026)
- Better capitalized than early health sharing plans

**Verdict:** Safer than health sharing (licensed) but less stable than major insurers (newer).

---

## State Availability

Presidio operates in select states. Availability limited compared to:
- ACA marketplace (nationwide)
- Medi-Share (nationwide)
- Health sharing alternatives (most states)

**Check Presidio website** for current state availability before planning enrollment.

---

## The Hybrid Approach: Presidio + CrowdHealth

Some families combine:
- **Presidio insurance** ($300/month) for baseline coverage + pre-existing
- **CrowdHealth** ($150/month) for supplemental crowdfunding option

**Total cost: $450/month** (higher than health sharing alone, but covers pre-existing immediately)

**Advantage:** Maximum protection (insurance guarantee + community funding backup)

---

## Bottom Line

**Presidio is better if:** You have pre-existing conditions, need mental health coverage, want legal protections, or value predictability over rock-bottom costs.

**Health sharing is better if:** You're young/healthy, faith-aligned, self-employed (tax deduction), and can accept informal coverage model.

**For families with pre-existing conditions:** Presidio is the clear winner despite slightly higher cost. The 12-month health sharing waiting period costs more in out-of-pocket medical expenses than the premium difference.
