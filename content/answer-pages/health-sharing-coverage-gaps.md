# Health Sharing Coverage Gaps: What's NOT Covered and Why

Health sharing plans don't cover preventive care (annual exams, cancer screenings), mental health (therapy, psychiatric medication), substance abuse treatment, cosmetic procedures, or routine dental/vision care. These gaps leave members paying $2,000–$5,000 annually out-of-pocket for services that insurance covers.

As of February 2026, health sharing organizations explicitly market themselves as "not insurance" partly to avoid covering preventive and mental health services required by law for insurance.

## What Health Sharing DOESN'T Cover (Comprehensive List)

| Category | What's Excluded | Cost Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Preventive Care** | Annual exams, cancer screenings, vaccines (adult) | $300–$800/year |
| **Mental Health** | Therapy, psychiatry, psychiatric medications | $2,000–$5,000/year |
| **Substance Abuse** | Rehab, addiction treatment, detox | $5,000–$30,000/treatment |
| **Routine Dental** | Cleanings, fillings, root canals | $1,000–$3,000/year |
| **Vision Care** | Exams, glasses, contacts, corrections | $200–$500/year |
| **Fertility** | IVF, fertility drugs, reproductive services | $10,000–$20,000/cycle |
| **Elective Surgery** | Cosmetic, non-medically necessary procedures | Varies widely |
| **Weight Loss** | Bariatric surgery, weight loss medications | $10,000–$30,000 |
| **Hearing Aids** | Devices and audiologist visits | $2,000–$6,000 |
| **Transgender Care** | Hormone therapy, transition surgery (on most plans) | $5,000–$40,000+ |
| **Erectile Dysfunction** | ED medications, treatments | $300–$1,000/year |

## Coverage Gaps vs. Insurance Requirements

**The ACA (Affordable Care Act) requires insurance to cover:**
- 100% of preventive care (no copay)
- Mental health parity (equal to physical health)
- Substance abuse treatment
- Emergency services
- Hospitalization
- Prescription drugs

**Health sharing plans skip these requirements because they claim "not insurance."**

This is both their cost advantage and their major risk gap.

## Preventive Care Gap: The Biggest Problem

Health sharing plans typically charge for preventive care (annual exams, screenings, vaccinations) that insurance covers for free.

**Annual costs if you use preventive care:**

| Item | Copay | Frequency | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Annual physical exam** | $20–$50 | 1x | $20–$50 |
| **Cancer screening (colonoscopy)** | $250–$500 | 1x (every 10 years) | $25–$50/year |
| **Blood work & labs** | $50–$100 | 1–2x | $50–$100 |
| **Vaccines (adult)** | $30–$50 | 1–3x | $30–$150 |
| **Pap smear/mammogram** | $100–$200 | 1x | $100–$200 |
| **Total annual preventive:** | | | **$225–$550** |

**With insurance (ACA):** $0  
**With health sharing:** $225–$550 additional out-of-pocket

## Mental Health Coverage Gap

This is the most critical gap for many households. Health sharing plans either:

1. **Exclude mental health entirely** (CHM, Samaritan Ministries on older plans)
2. **Cover psychiatry but not therapy** (Medi-Share)
3. **Limit mental health visits** (6–10 visits/year)
4. **Don't cover psychiatric medications** (list varies by plan)

**Mental health treatment costs without coverage:**

| Service | Without Coverage | With Insurance |
|---|---|---|
| **Therapist (weekly, 52 visits)** | $6,000–$10,000/year | $0–$150/year (copay) |
| **Psychiatrist (monthly, 12 visits)** | $3,000–$6,000/year | $0–$200/year (copay) |
| **Psychiatric medications** | $200–$500/month | $10–$50/month (copay) |
| **Crisis inpatient (7 days)** | $7,000–$15,000 | $500–$2,000 (copay) |
| **Total annual (therapy + meds)** | **$8,000–$15,000** | **$500–$2,500** |

**Cost gap: $6,500–$13,000 annually**

If a family member has depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or ADHD requiring medication, health sharing can create dangerous affordability barriers.

## Dental and Vision Gaps

Health sharing plans universally exclude routine dental and vision. Separate dental/vision plans (if you need them) cost $10–$30/month additional.

**Typical costs without coverage:**

| Service | Cost | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **Dental cleaning** | $100–$200 | 2x/year |
| **Dental fillings** | $200–$400 | As needed |
| **Eye exam** | $75–$150 | 1x/year |
| **Glasses/contacts** | $200–$500 | Every 1–2 years |
| **Total annual (1 person)** | **$600–$1,200** | |

## Substance Abuse Treatment Gap

Most health sharing plans exclude or severely limit substance abuse treatment (alcohol, drugs). This is a critical gap for families with addiction issues.

**Rehab costs without coverage:**
- Inpatient 30-day program: $5,000–$30,000
- Outpatient treatment (3 months): $2,000–$10,000
- Medication-assisted treatment (annual): $1,000–$5,000

**With insurance:** $500–$2,000 out-of-pocket (maximum)  
**With health sharing:** Full cost or partial (varies by plan)

---

## What Plans Cover These Gaps (Poorly)

**Best plans for mental health:**
- Medi-Share: Limited therapy (copay), psychiatric meds covered
- Zion Health: 10 therapy visits/year, meds covered
- Sedera: No mental health exclusion (covers if medically necessary)

**All plans exclude:**
- Preventive care (mostly)
- Routine dental/vision
- Fertility treatment
- Cosmetic surgery
- Weight loss surgery

## The "Not Insurance" Loophole

Health sharing organizations explicitly state they are "not insurance" to avoid ACA requirements. This allows them to:

1. Exclude preventive care (insurance must cover 100%)
2. Limit mental health (insurance must have parity)
3. Exclude certain treatments (insurance can't exclude pre-approved services)
4. Not guarantee claim payment (insurance legally must)

**This is why health sharing is cheap—it excludes expensive categories.**

---

## Coverage Gap Workarounds

**If you choose health sharing, fill gaps with:**

1. **Supplemental dental/vision plans** ($10–$30/month)
2. **Direct primary care membership** ($50–$150/month) for preventive care
3. **HSA funds** ($300–$600/year) for out-of-pocket preventive care
4. **Online therapy platforms** ($60–$300/month) for mental health
5. **Generic psychiatric medications** ($10–$30/month on GoodRx)

**Total cost to fill gaps: $100–$300/month additional**

This can erase health sharing's cost advantage quickly.

## Bottom Line on Coverage Gaps

Health sharing saves money by excluding services that insurance is legally required to cover. If you need any of these services, those savings disappear:

- Mental health care (therapy/psychiatric meds)
- Preventive screenings (cancer screening, annual exam)
- Dental/vision care
- Substance abuse treatment

For healthy people with no mental health needs and good preventive care habits (regular exercise, no smoking), these gaps don't matter.

For anyone managing chronic mental health, dental disease, or aging-related preventive needs, these gaps can make health sharing unaffordable.

## FAQ

**Does health sharing cover therapy at all?**

It depends on the plan. Some plans (Medi-Share) cover psychiatry but not therapy. Some (Zion) cover limited therapy (6–10 visits/year). Others exclude mental health entirely.

**Can I use my HSA for uncovered preventive care?**

Yes. HSA funds can pay for annual exams, screenings, and vaccines not covered by health sharing. This partially fills the gap.

**What if I develop depression after enrolling?**

Once enrolled, health sharing cannot deny depression treatment if the plan covers mental health. However, if your plan excludes mental health, you pay 100% out-of-pocket for any mental health care.

**Do any plans cover therapy without limits?**

No. Even plans that cover mental health cap therapy visits (Zion: 10 visits/year). For unlimited therapy, you need insurance or a direct primary care membership.

**As of February 2026.** Review coverage exclusions before enrolling. If you need mental health care, dental, vision, or preventive services, calculate those costs separately and add to health sharing costs.
