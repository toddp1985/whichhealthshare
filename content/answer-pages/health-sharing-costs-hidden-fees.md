# Health Sharing Costs and Hidden Fees: The Full Price Breakdown

Health sharing advertises $225/month premiums but actual costs are $250–$400/month when including annual shares ($500–$2,000), specialist copays ($50–$100), prescription copays ($10–$40), and member responsibility percentages (10–30%). Advertised prices omit 30–50% of typical member costs.

As of February 2026, health sharing organizations are not required to disclose full cost breakdowns upfront, leading members to discover hidden fees after enrollment.

## Advertised vs. Actual Monthly Costs

| Item | Medi-Share | Zion | CHM | What It Is |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Advertised "monthly commitment"** | $225 | $195 | $180 | Base monthly payment only |
| **Annual share (deductible-like)** | $500 | $600 | $750 | Paid before org covers claims |
| **Specialist copay** | $50–$100 | $35–$75 | $40–$80 | Per specialist visit |
| **Prescription copay** | $15–$40 | $10–$35 | $20–$50 | Per prescription |
| **Member responsibility %** | 10–15% | 15–20% | 20–30% | Share of remaining bill |
| **Facility fees not covered** | $200–$500 | $100–$300 | $150–$400 | ER/surgery facility charges |
| **True monthly cost (average usage)** | $350–$450 | $280–$380 | $250–$350 | Realistic with typical care |

## The "$225/Month" Trap

Health sharing organizations advertise a single number: "$225/month" or "$195/month." This is misleading.

**What "$225/month" includes:**
- Your basic monthly membership fee
- NOT annual deductible (additional cost)
- NOT copays (additional cost)
- NOT member responsibility % (additional cost)
- NOT facility fees (additional cost)

**Analogy:** Advertising a gym membership as "$30/month" without mentioning locker rental ($5), personal trainer sessions ($50), and towel fees ($3). True cost is higher.

## Typical Member Costs Breakdown (Monthly)

**Medi-Share, single adult, basic plan, 2 doctor visits/year:**

- Advertised monthly commitment: $225
- Annual share cost amortized: $42 ($500 ÷ 12)
- Typical copays & responsibility: $50–$100/month
- **Realistic monthly cost: $317–$367**
- **Annual cost: $3,800–$4,400** (not $2,700)

**This is why actual out-of-pocket costs are 50%+ higher than advertised.**

## Fee Categories Explained

### 1. Annual Share (Deductible-Like Fee)

**Amount:** $500–$2,000 (varies by plan and coverage level)

**What it is:** A mandatory lump-sum payment per year. Until you pay the annual share, the organization covers $0 of claims.

**Timing:** Usually due quarterly ($125–$500 per quarter) or annually.

**Example:** Medi-Share annual share of $500 = $42/month additional cost.

**Note:** This is NOT like an insurance deductible. It's a separate, flat fee that doesn't contribute to coverage limits.

### 2. Specialist Copays

**Amount:** $50–$100 per specialist visit

**What they cover:** Cardiologist, orthopedist, dermatologist, therapist, etc.

**What they don't cover:** Primary care (usually $0–$20), emergency (usually $0).

**Cost impact:** Someone with chronic condition seeing specialist monthly = $50–$100/month in copays alone.

### 3. Prescription Copays

**Amount:** $10–$50 per prescription (varies by tier)

**Tier 1 (generic):** $10–$15
**Tier 2 (brand-name):** $25–$40
**Tier 3 (specialty):** $50–$150

**Cost impact:** Someone on 3 daily medications = $30–$150/month in prescription costs.

**Note:** Health sharing typically has no annual prescription deductible, so copays apply immediately.

### 4. Member Responsibility Percentage

**Amount:** 10–30% of remaining bill after organization's share

**How it works:** Organization covers 70–90%, you cover 10–30% of actual charges.

**Example:** $5,000 ER visit
- Organization pays: $4,000 (80%)
- You pay: $1,000 (20%)

This is unlimited. A $50,000 surgery = $10,000 member responsibility.

### 5. Facility Fees and Administrative Costs

**Amount:** $100–$500 per visit/procedure

**What it covers:** Hospital facility fees, administrative costs, facility charges not covered by organization.

**Example:** Outpatient surgery facility fee of $1,500 may be 100% member responsibility.

**Note:** Not all plans clearly disclose this; you may discover it after a claim.

### 6. Pre-Existing Waiting Period Costs

**Amount:** 12 months of full-price premiums with $0 coverage

**What it is:** If you have a pre-existing condition, you pay full cost for 12 months before coverage begins.

**Example:** Diabetic enrolls in Medi-Share, pays $2,700 in premiums during year 1, but diabetes-related claims get $0 coverage during that time.

**True 12-month cost:** $2,700 (premiums) + $3,000–$5,000 (out-of-pocket medication/care) = $5,700–$7,700

## Cost Transparency Issues

**What health sharing organizations disclose:**
- Monthly commitment amount (advertised)
- Annual share amount (in fine print)

**What they often omit or hide:**
- Typical member responsibility % (varies by plan)
- Specialist copays (not mentioned in marketing)
- Facility fee policies (buried in 50-page documents)
- Claim denial rates (not published)
- Processing time averages (varies widely)

**Result:** Members think they're paying $225/month and discover actual costs are $325–$400/month after enrollment.

## Real Cost Example: Unplanned Hospital Visit

**Scenario: 35-year-old, acute appendicitis, emergency surgery**

**Billed charges:** $18,000

**Medi-Share coverage (assuming post-waiting period):**
- Organization pays (80%): $14,400
- Member responsibility (20%): $3,600
- Facility fees (member responsible): $500
- **Your out-of-pocket: $4,100**

**Plus your ongoing costs:**
- Monthly commitments (year): $2,700
- Annual share: $500
- **Total annual cost: $7,300 for this single event**

**With ACA insurance (same scenario):**
- Monthly premiums (year): $6,000
- Deductible: $1,000
- Coinsurance (after deductible): 20% of $7,000 = $1,400
- Out-of-pocket cap: $7,000 (max legally allowed)
- **Total annual cost: $7,000 (capped by law)**

**Cost difference: Breakeven. No savings from health sharing in this case.**

## How to Calculate Your True Monthly Cost

1. **Start with advertised monthly commitment:** $225
2. **Add annual share (amortized):** $500 ÷ 12 = $42/month
3. **Estimate annual healthcare usage:**
   - 2–3 doctor visits: $50–$100/month copay
   - 1–2 prescriptions: $20–$40/month
   - Occasional specialist: +$50–$100/month
4. **Total realistic monthly cost: $300–$450**

Don't trust the "$225/month" marketing. Add 30–50% to get realistic costs.

## FAQ

**Is the annual share mandatory?**

Yes. You must pay the annual share before the organization covers any claims (except emergency). It's not optional, though some plans allow payment plans ($125/quarter vs. $500 lump sum).

**Are facility fees separate from the organization's 80% coverage?**

It depends on the plan. Some facility fees are covered under the 80%. Others are 100% member responsibility. Check your plan documents carefully.

**Can I opt out of prescriptions copays?**

No. If you fill a prescription, you pay the copay. If you want to avoid copays, some plans offer mail-order generic copays at $5–$10.

**Do these hidden fees appear in the contract?**

Yes, they're in the fine print. Most plans have 50+ page contracts outlining all fees. The problem is they're not highlighted in marketing materials.

**As of February 2026.** Always request a **full cost disclosure** before enrolling. Ask about annual share, copays, member responsibility %, and facility fees.
