# Health Sharing for Families: Costs, Coverage, and How It Works

Family health sharing plans typically cost $250–$500/month per family (vs. $1,200+ for ACA marketplace plans), covering preventive care, hospitalizations, and emergency services. Most plans exclude pre-existing conditions in the first 6–12 months and don't cover routine expenses like annual checkups without cost-sharing.

As of February 2026, family health sharing has become more attractive for households earning $40k–$150k annually, particularly those willing to participate in wellness activities in exchange for lower premiums.

## Key Facts at a Glance

| Factor | Health Sharing | ACA Marketplace | Self-Insure |
|--------|---|---|---|
| **Monthly cost (family of 4)** | $300–$450 | $1,000–$1,500 | $0 upfront |
| **Deductible equivalent** | $500–$2,500 | $500–$5,000+ | 100% cost |
| **Pre-existing conditions** | 6–12 month wait | Covered immediately | Not applicable |
| **Preventive care** | Limited/cost-share | Fully covered | Out of pocket |
| **Appeal/denial process** | Informal | Legal protections | Not applicable |
| **Faith requirement** | Most plans (Medi-Share, CHM) | No | Not applicable |
| **Best for families with** | Stable health, faith alignment | Pre-existing conditions | Very low income (Medicaid eligible) |

## 1. How Family Health Sharing Differs from Insurance

Health sharing is not insurance. Members pay monthly "shares" into a mutual fund that covers other members' medical bills. The organization doesn't guarantee coverage—it depends on fund availability. Insurance pools risk legally; health sharing pools risk informally.

**Insurance covers medical claims up to limits. Health sharing covers medical claims based on available funds.**

For families, this distinction matters most when a member has a major health event (cancer, surgery) during a pre-existing condition exclusion period. In insurance, you're covered. In health sharing, the claim may be partially covered or deferred if funds run low.

Medi-Share (largest plan) covered 96% of submitted claims in 2025. CHM (Church Health Ministry) covered 89%. These aren't legal guarantees—they're historical patterns.

## 2. Typical Costs for a Family of 4

**Basic coverage tier:**
- Medi-Share: $325–$375/month
- Zion Health: $275–$325/month
- CHM: $250–$300/month
- Samaritan Ministries: $300–$350/month

**Actual out-of-pocket costs:**
- Annual share (like a deductible): $500–$2,000
- Preventive care copays: $15–$50 (varies by plan)
- Prescription copays: $10–$40
- Specialist referral fees: $50–$100

**Total annual cost for family with no major medical events:** $5,500–$8,000.

Compare: ACA marketplace (bronze plan) for family of 4 = $12,000–$18,000 annually.

## 3. What's Covered and What Isn't

**Typically covered:**
- Hospitalizations (emergency and planned)
- Surgery
- ER visits
- Maternity (after 9–12 month waiting period on most plans)
- Prescriptions (with copay)
- Mental health (limited)
- Diagnostic imaging (X-rays, MRI, CT)

**Not covered or highly restricted:**
- Routine preventive care (annual exams, screenings)
- Elective procedures (cosmetic surgery, non-medically necessary dental)
- Chronic condition management in first 6–12 months
- Long-term care or nursing home
- Substance abuse treatment (on conservative plans)
- HIV/AIDS treatment (on faith-based plans with exclusions)

## 4. Pre-Existing Conditions and Family Eligibility

Most family health sharing plans exclude pre-existing conditions for 6–12 months. If your child was diagnosed with asthma before joining, asthma-related care is excluded until the waiting period ends.

**Plans with shorter or no waiting periods:**
- Zion Health: 6-month wait for most conditions; 12 months for serious conditions
- Sedera: No pre-existing waiting period (explicit policy)
- CrowdHealth (alternative model): No pre-existing condition exclusions

For families with chronic conditions (diabetes, asthma, ADHD), the waiting period can make health sharing expensive. A child needing monthly medication for 6 months means paying out-of-pocket during the exclusion period.

## 5. Lifestyle and Faith Requirements

Most major health sharing plans (Medi-Share, CHM, Samaritan) require members to adhere to faith-based lifestyle guidelines:
- No smoking
- No illegal drugs
- Modest alcohol consumption (if any)
- Some plans: No premarital relations, no LGBTQ+ status

Violations can result in membership termination or claims denial.

**Secular alternatives:**
- Zion Health: No faith requirement (agnostic-friendly)
- Sedera: No faith requirement
- CrowdHealth: No lifestyle requirements (modern crowdfunding model)

For families with LGBTQ+ members or non-religious households, faith-based plans may create barriers.

## 6. Monthly Commitment vs. Insurance Premiums

Health sharing requires a "monthly commitment" (the payment) but doesn't legally obligate the organization to cover claims. You can be terminated for:
- Non-payment (standard)
- Lifestyle violations (above)
- Moving out of the plan's service area
- Failure to meet wellness requirements (some plans)

Once terminated, re-enrollment may be subject to new pre-existing waiting periods.

Insurance premiums are contractual; you have legal recourse if claims are unfairly denied.

## 7. The Bottom Line for Families

Health sharing makes financial sense for families that are:
- Healthy (no pre-existing conditions, or willing to wait out exclusions)
- Faith-aligned or accepting of lifestyle requirements
- Earning $40k–$150k (in the sweet spot for cost savings)
- Comfortable with informal coverage (higher personal risk)
- Planning predictable medical needs (pregnancies, planned surgery)

Health sharing is **risky** for families with:
- Chronic conditions requiring immediate treatment
- Immunocompromised members
- Mental health conditions requiring ongoing care
- LGBTQ+ members on faith-based plans
- High utilization expectations

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use health sharing if I have a child with a chronic condition?**

Yes, but the pre-existing waiting period (6–12 months) means you'll pay out-of-pocket during that time. If your child needs continuous medication, calculate the 12-month cost before enrolling. For severe conditions, ACA marketplace coverage (which covers pre-existing immediately) may be cheaper.

**Does health sharing cover prenatal care and delivery?**

Most plans have a 9–12 month waiting period for maternity. If you plan to get pregnant immediately, this makes health sharing unsuitable unless you're willing to pay delivery costs ($8,000–$15,000) out-of-pocket. Some plans (Zion) waive the maternity wait if you enroll before pregnancy confirmation.

**What happens if I can't pay my monthly share?**

Membership terminates (like insurance premium non-payment). However, some plans offer short grace periods (7–30 days). Unlike insurance, there's no legal obligation to continue coverage or re-enroll you after termination.

**Are lifestyle violations really grounds for termination?**

Yes. If you smoke and membership terms forbid it, claims may be denied and membership terminated. The burden is on the organization to catch and enforce, so enforcement varies by plan size.

**Can I switch plans mid-year?**

Yes, but you'll restart pre-existing waiting periods on your new plan. If you leave Medi-Share after 2 months and join Zion, your pre-existing conditions wait starts over.

2. **Compare quotes** — Get pricing from Medi-Share, Zion, and CHM for your family size.
3. **Check pre-existing exclusions** — Call each plan directly to confirm what conditions are excluded.
4. **Review lifestyle requirements** — Ensure your family aligns with the plan's ethical guidelines.
5. **Calculate break-even point** — If family health costs exceed $8,000–$10,000 annually, consider ACA marketplace instead.
6. **Start enrollment** — Most plans have 30–60 day waiting periods before coverage begins.
