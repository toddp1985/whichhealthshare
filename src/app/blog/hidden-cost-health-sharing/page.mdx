Health sharing plans advertise monthly fees ($115–$405), but the real cost is substantially higher when you factor in out-of-pocket amounts ($1,000–$5,000 per claim), advisory fees (CrowdHealth charges 30–43% on claims), uncovered services (mental health, dental, fertility, vision), and waiting periods that leave you exposed. When you actually need medical care, health sharing costs more than most people budget for—often $3,000–$6,000 annually in total out-of-pocket spending.

## The Real Cost of Health Sharing: Monthly Fee + Everything Else

| Cost Category | Health Sharing | ACA Insurance | CrowdHealth |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Monthly Fee** | $200–$350 | $150–$450 (with subsidy) | $140 |
| **Annual Fee (12 mo)** | $2,400–$4,200 | $1,800–$5,400 | $1,680 |
| **Out-of-Pocket Per Claim** | $1,000–$5,000 | $0–$2,500 | $0 (but advisory fee) |
| **Claim Advisory Fee** | None | None | 30–43% of bill |
| **Typical Year Cost (1 claim)** | $3,400–$9,200 | $1,800–$8,000 | $3,000–$7,000 |
| **Typical Year Cost (3+ claims)** | $5,400–$18,000+ | $2,500–$10,000 | $6,000–$15,000+ |

## The Deductible That's Not Called a Deductible

Health sharing ministries don't have deductibles. They have something worse: **out-of-pocket minimums that are higher and less transparent.**

When you file a claim with Medi-Share, you're responsible for the first $1,000–$5,000 depending on your coverage level. Medi-Share calls it a "self-pay amount." CHM calls it your "responsibility." It's not a deductible (because deductibles are regulated), but it functions exactly like one.

The difference: With insurance, you pay your deductible, then the insurance company pays its share. You know the deal upfront.

With health sharing, you pay your "self-pay amount," and then the ministry shares the remaining cost—but whether they actually share it depends on their guidelines, your waiting periods, and whether the claim fits their coverage rules.

**Real example:** You have a $8,000 surgery. Your health sharing plan has a $2,500 "self-pay amount."
- You pay: $2,500 (your responsibility)
- Plan should share: $5,500
- Actual result: Plan covers $4,200, rejects $1,300 because the procedure was deemed "elective" or "not medically necessary"
- **You end up paying: $4,100 (not just $2,500)**

You took on the risk of a $2,500 out-of-pocket amount, but you actually paid $4,100 because the plan rejected part of the claim. That's the hidden cost.

**Frustrated with hidden out-of-pocket costs?** CrowdHealth has no "responsibility" amounts upfront. You submit a claim, other members fund it, and you only pay if funding falls short. [See how CrowdHealth's transparency compares to traditional health sharing.](/reviews/crowdhealth)

## The Coverage Gaps That Cost You Thousands

Every health sharing plan advertises broad coverage, then excludes massive categories:

**Mental health:** Most plans cover 20–40 mental health visits per year. Therapy typically costs $100–$200 per session. If you need 50 visits (common for someone dealing with depression or anxiety), you're paying $2,000–$4,000 out-of-pocket.

**Dental:** Almost no health sharing plan covers dental. A root canal costs $1,500–$2,500. You're paying full price.

**Vision:** Glasses and contacts aren't covered. Annual eye care is $200–$400 out-of-pocket, every year.

**Fertility and pregnancy complications:** Most plans exclude fertility treatment (IVF, intrauterine insemination, medications). They also exclude certain pregnancy complications. If you're trying to conceive or have complicated pregnancies, you're paying $5,000–$20,000 per cycle or event.

**High-cost medications:** Many plans have a limit on monthly pharmaceutical costs ($400–$600). If you're on a specialty drug that costs $2,000/month, you're responsible for the amount over the limit. That's $19,200/year out-of-pocket.

**Preventive care:** Some plans don't cover preventive procedures (colonoscopy, mammography). Annual preventive care can cost $500–$1,500 depending on age and risk.

These gaps aren't fine print—they're fundamental. When you do the math, you're not just paying a monthly fee. You're paying a monthly fee PLUS the full cost of entire categories of care.

## Waiting Periods = Uninsured Months (or Years)

Health sharing ministries have waiting periods for pre-existing conditions. During those waiting periods, you're not covered. You're paying premiums for something you can't use.

**Example:** You join Medi-Share on January 1, 2026. You have Type 2 diabetes. Medi-Share has a 12-month waiting period for pre-existing conditions, stretching to 14 months for chronic diseases.

- January 2026–March 2027: You can file claims for anything EXCEPT diabetes-related care. If you have a respiratory infection, sure, you're covered. But your monthly diabetes supplies, doctor visits, and medication are on you.
- March 2027 onward: You're finally covered for diabetes.

You paid $2,940 in monthly fees (Jan–March 2027) for a plan that didn't cover your main health issue. That's the hidden cost of waiting periods.

And here's the kicker: If you leave the plan before the waiting period ends and join a different one, many plans restart the waiting period. So switching costs you time and money.

<CalloutBox type="presidio">
**Pre-existing conditions too risky?** [Presidio Healthcare](/reviews/presidio-healthcare) is insurance—it covers pre-existing conditions day 1, no waiting period. It's more expensive than health sharing ($250–$450/month), but you're actually covered from the start.

## Claim Rejections: The Cost Nobody Budgets For

Health sharing plans reject claims. Regularly.

Insurance companies reject claims too, but they face regulatory oversight and appeals processes. Health sharing plans don't. They can reject your claim, and you have limited recourse.

Common rejection reasons:

**"This procedure is elective."** You get a cyst removed from your shoulder. The plan decides it's cosmetic, not medically necessary. Rejection. You're out $3,000.

**"This diagnosis isn't covered."** You file for mental health treatment. The plan says it only covers mental health after medically diagnosed conditions, not preventive therapy. Rejection. You're out $1,500 for the sessions you already had.

**"This violates guidelines."** You see an out-of-network doctor without pre-authorization. The plan covers it at 50% instead of 100%. Rejection of 50%. You expected $3,000 shared, you got $1,500.

**"Pre-existing condition exclusion."** You have asthma. You join the plan. You file for an asthma inhaler refill. The plan says you had asthma when you joined, so this is pre-existing, so it's not covered. Rejection. You're out $200.

None of these are negotiable. You don't get an appeals process like insurance. You lose.

Members report rejection rates between 5–15% of claims, depending on the plan. That means if you file 10 claims per year, 0.5–1.5 will be rejected, costing you hundreds to thousands unexpectedly.

## Advisory Fees: CrowdHealth's Hidden Cost

CrowdHealth advertises $140/month average. What they don't emphasize: You also pay an advisory fee when you file a claim.

Advisory fee: 30–43% of the claim amount. That's not transparent when you're comparing it to traditional health sharing (which charges flat monthly fees with no percentage costs).

**Example:** You have a surgery for $15,000.
- Traditional health sharing: You pay your $2,000 out-of-pocket amount, the plan shares $13,000. Total cost: $2,000 out-of-pocket + monthly fees.
- CrowdHealth: You pay $0 upfront (no deductible), but you pay 30–43% advisory fee. That's $4,500–$6,450 to CrowdHealth for processing the claim. Plus monthly fees. Total cost: $4,500–$6,450 out-of-pocket + monthly fees.

For someone with major medical events, CrowdHealth's advisory fee structure means you're actually paying more in real dollars than traditional health sharing, even though the monthly base cost looks cheap.

**When CrowdHealth wins:** No medical events (you save on monthly fees alone).

**When traditional health sharing wins:** Frequent or expensive medical events (flat monthly fees beat percentage-based advisory fees).

## The Real Annual Cost: Budget for $4,000–$8,000

If you're considering health sharing, don't budget just the monthly fee. Budget the full reality:

**Best case (healthy person, no claims):**
- Monthly fees: $1,680–$4,200/year
- **Total: $1,680–$4,200/year**

**Realistic case (one moderate claim):**
- Monthly fees: $2,400/year
- Out-of-pocket amount: $2,500
- Coverage gaps (dental, vision, uncovered services): $1,000
- **Total: $5,900/year**

**Higher-need case (3+ claims or one major event):**
- Monthly fees: $3,000/year
- Out-of-pocket amounts: $5,000–$15,000
- Coverage gaps: $2,000–$5,000
- Claim rejections (unexpected): $500–$2,000
- **Total: $10,500–$25,000/year**

Health sharing is cheap if you stay healthy. The moment you need medical care, costs spike because of the hidden deductibles, gaps, and rejections baked into the model.

## The Bottom Line

Health sharing's real cost isn't the monthly fee. It's the monthly fee plus out-of-pocket amounts, coverage gaps, advisory fees, and the risk of claim rejections.

For a healthy 30-year-old with no major medical events, health sharing at $150–$250/month is legitimately cheap. But the moment you file a substantial claim, you're paying $3,000–$10,000 out-of-pocket depending on the plan and the event.

If you have any pre-existing conditions, chronic medications, or expect multiple claims per year, the true cost of health sharing often exceeds ACA insurance with subsidies. Do the math for your situation before committing.
