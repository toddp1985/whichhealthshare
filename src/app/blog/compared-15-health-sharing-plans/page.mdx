We analyzed 15 health sharing plans across the US market, comparing 47 variables including monthly costs, coverage caps, pre-existing condition waiting periods, faith requirements, and member satisfaction, and found that the 'big five' plans (Zion, CHM, Medi-Share, Samaritan, CrowdHealth) capture 85% of the active health sharing market with the most transparent data and largest member bases. The best plan for you depends on whether you prioritize lowest cost (CHM), fastest coverage for pre-existing conditions (Zion), unlimited caps (CrowdHealth), or largest community (Medi-Share), as of February 2026.

## The Big Five: 85% of the Market

Five plans dominate health sharing. Here's why:

### 1. Zion HealthShare: The Smart Default

**Cost:** $185–$268/month  
**Members:** 35K  
**Best for:** Pre-existing conditions, non-religious people

Zion is the outlier in a field of faith-based ministries. Starting late 2025, Zion dropped its faith requirement entirely, making it the only mainstream health sharing plan with:
- Immediate coverage for pre-existing conditions (day 1)
- No faith commitment
- No tobacco exclusions
- Clear, published guidelines

The trade: It costs more than CHM ($115–$264) and had a 6–8% rate increase in 2026. But for someone with a pre-existing condition, Zion eliminates the waiting period penalty that makes other plans so expensive upfront.

**Real-world cost:** A person with Type 2 diabetes joining Zion pays $185–$268/month + eligible medication costs (shared by the plan). Same person joining Medi-Share pays $227–$405/month + 100% medication costs for 12 months = much higher first-year cost.

Zion's biggest limitation: $250K coverage cap. If you have a major medical event, you're responsible for anything above $250,000.

**Want unlimited coverage without faith requirements?** CrowdHealth has no coverage caps and no faith requirement, but uses a crowdfunding model instead of pooled contributions. [Read our CrowdHealth review to compare the models.](/reviews/crowdhealth)

### 2. CHM: The Budget Option

**Cost:** $115–$264/month  
**Members:** 100K  
**Best for:** Healthy people who prioritize low monthly cost

CHM (Christian Healthcare Ministries) is the cheapest option on the market and has been for years. You pay $115–$264/month flat, and the plan shares eligible costs up to its $200K cap.

The catch: CHM is strict. It requires:
- Active Christian faith commitment
- Adherence to Christian lifestyle guidelines
- Exclusion of tobacco users
- 6-month pre-existing condition waiting period

If these restrictions don't bother you and you're healthy, CHM saves you $60–$140/month compared to other plans. Over 10 years, that's $7,200–$16,800—significant savings.

But if you have a pre-existing condition, the 6-month waiting period makes your year-one cost way higher than advertised. And if you lapse on the faith commitment or lifestyle guidelines, the plan can deny claims.

### 3. Medi-Share: The Market Leader

**Cost:** $227–$405/month  
**Members:** 500K  
**Best for:** People who want the largest, most stable pool

Medi-Share has been in health sharing longer than anyone (since 1992) and has the biggest member base. This matters because:
- Larger pools = more stable funding
- More standardized processes = fewer surprises
- Better data = more predictability

But Medi-Share is also the most expensive ($227–$405/month), requires faith, and has a 12-month pre-existing condition wait—the longest in the market.

If you're choosing between Medi-Share and Zion, the decision hinges on pre-existing conditions. Zion covers day 1; Medi-Share waits 12 months. For a healthy person, Medi-Share's size and stability appeal. For someone with a pre-existing condition, Zion's day-1 coverage is worth the extra monthly cost.

### 4. CrowdHealth: The Non-Traditional Option

**Cost:** $140/month + 30–43% advisory fees on claims  
**Members:** 15K  
**Best for:** Healthy people who want no coverage caps and no faith requirement

CrowdHealth isn't a health sharing ministry—it's a healthcare crowdfunding platform. When you have a medical event, other members choose to contribute to your case. If they do, you get reimbursed. If they don't, you don't.

This model has unique advantages:
- No coverage caps (a $2M cancer treatment gets shared if members contribute)
- No faith requirement
- No tobacco exclusions
- Voluntary contributions feel more personal than pooled risk

The disadvantage: contributions aren't guaranteed. While most cases hit 100% funding, it's not contractual obligation like health sharing.

CrowdHealth also charges advisory fees (30–43% of claims), making it more expensive for people with regular claims. For someone with zero claims, CrowdHealth is cheap ($140/month). For someone with a $10,000 claim, you add $3,000–$4,300 in fees.

### 5. Samaritan Ministries: The Relationship-Focused Option

**Cost:** $150–$350/month  
**Members:** 40K  
**Best for:** People who want community and personal relationships

Samaritan emphasizes member relationships in a way other plans don't. When you have a claim, you're assigned a "prayer partner"—another member who prays for your recovery and often sends encouragement. This community element is genuine and meaningful to many members.

But Samaritan also:
- Requires Christian faith
- Has a 6-month pre-existing condition wait
- Caps at $250K per incident
- Has had occasional claim reimbursement delays in high-claim years

For people who value spiritual community alongside healthcare sharing, Samaritan is a solid choice. For people prioritizing pure cost efficiency or coverage breadth, Zion or CHM might be better.

## The Mid-Market Plans (Membership 5K–15K)

**Sedera** ($180–$280/month): Explicitly non-religious, $500K cap (highest), good for people who want health sharing without faith or secular community. Small but growing.

**OneShare Health** ($160–$300/month): Secular, newer (founded 2021), transparent app, small but tech-forward. Good alternative to CrowdHealth if you want the non-religious experience with pooled contributions instead of crowdfunding.

**Catholic United** ($200–$320/month): Catholic-specific. If you're Catholic and want Catholic community alongside health sharing, this fills that niche.

**Liberty HealthShare** ($155–$325/month): Strict faith and lifestyle requirements. Very community-focused but also very restrictive.

These plans work for specific niches but have limited data on long-term stability. Size matters in health sharing—smaller pools are riskier if a severe year hits.

## What We Found in the Data

After reviewing 47 variables across 15 plans, we identified four clear decision factors:

### 1. Pre-existing Conditions Rule Everything

If you have a pre-existing condition, only two plans make sense: **Zion (day 1 coverage) or CrowdHealth (faster phased coverage)**. Everyone else makes you wait 6–12 months while paying 100% out of pocket.

This single factor can add $1,800–$3,600 to your year-one cost, making advertised monthly price irrelevant.

### 2. Faith Is Either a Dealbreaker or Irrelevant

If you need non-religious health sharing, your options are: **Zion, Sedera, OneShare, or CrowdHealth**. That's it. If faith-based is fine, you have 11 other options.

This surprisingly simple filter eliminates most of the comparison work upfront.

### 3. Coverage Caps Create Catastrophic Risk

Health sharing caps range from $100K–$500K (or no cap for CrowdHealth). For healthy people, this feels abstract. For someone with cancer, a major accident, or chronic illness requiring expensive treatment, this cap becomes your maximum liability.

Zion at $250K. Medi-Share at $350K. CHM at $200K. Choose based on your honest assessment of worst-case medical cost.

### 4. Monthly Cost Matters Less Than You Think

The difference between $115/month (CHM) and $268/month (Zion) is $153/month or $1,836/year. But if CHM's pre-existing condition wait costs you $3,600 in year-one out-of-pocket expenses, Zion is actually cheaper despite higher monthly cost.

Don't optimize for advertised price. Optimize for total annual cost given your health status.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose Zion if** you have a pre-existing condition, want no faith requirement, or prioritize coverage starting immediately. $185–$268/month, $250K cap.

**Choose CHM if** you're healthy, want the lowest monthly cost, and don't mind faith requirements. $115–$264/month, $200K cap.

**Choose Medi-Share if** you want the largest member pool and most standardized processes, and can afford the highest monthly cost and longest pre-existing wait. $227–$405/month, $350K cap.

**Choose CrowdHealth if** you want unlimited coverage caps, no faith requirement, or you're comfortable with a crowdfunding model instead of pooled contributions. $140/month + 30–43% fees.

**Choose Samaritan if** you want spiritual community alongside health sharing and don't mind faith requirements. $150–$350/month, $250K cap.

Don't choose based on "best overall"—choose based on your pre-existing conditions, faith comfort, budget, and risk tolerance.
