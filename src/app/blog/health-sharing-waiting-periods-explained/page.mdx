Health sharing plans impose 30–90 day waiting periods for new members and 12–24 month exclusions for pre-existing conditions because they operate as member-funded communities rather than insured products with regulatory reserves. As of Feb 2026, these waiting periods mean you cannot immediately claim maternity, mental health, or chronic disease expenses—a critical gap if you enroll during an active health crisis.

## Your Key Questions Answered

### Why Would Any Organization Impose a Waiting Period?
Health sharing operates on a different financial model than insurance. Insurance companies collect premiums upfront, then use investment returns and premiums to build reserves that cover claims. Health sharing collects member contributions monthly and uses that month's money to pay that month's claims (pay-as-you-go model). New members haven't yet contributed enough funds to justify covering their claims immediately. The 30–90 day waiting period allows new members to contribute 1–3 months of dues before claims begin. It's a cash flow protection mechanism, not a medical qualification test.
### What's the Difference Between General and Pre-Existing Waiting Periods?
The general new-member waiting period (30–90 days) applies to everyone regardless of health status. After this period, most care becomes eligible. Pre-existing condition waiting periods (12–24 months) apply only to conditions you had before enrolling. If you enroll with no diagnoses, you skip pre-existing waiting periods. If you enroll with diabetes, that 12–24 month exclusion applies only to diabetes-related claims—other health issues are covered after the general waiting period. Some people confuse these and think they're locked out of all care for 2 years (not true).
### When Do Waiting Periods Actually Cost Money?
Scenario 1: You enroll in health sharing on January 1 with a 60-day waiting period. You get appendicitis on February 15 (before waiting period ends). Cost: ~$8,000–$12,000 out-of-pocket. Scenario 2: You enroll with pre-existing diabetes and a 24-month waiting period. You need insulin refills during months 1–24. Cost: $200–$400/month out-of-pocket. Scenario 3: You enroll and become pregnant before the maternity waiting period ends (9–12 months). Delivery cost: $10,000–$15,000 out-of-pocket. These gaps are significant financial risks that many people underestimate when signing up for health sharing.
### Are There Any Exceptions to Waiting Periods?
Most health sharing plans exclude waiting periods for emergency/life-threatening conditions, but they define 'emergency' narrowly. A broken bone is covered immediately; a non-emergency surgery is not. Maternity waiting periods have no exceptions—you cannot deliver before the waiting period ends. Pre-existing condition waiting periods are absolute; some organizations won't budge even for emergency complications related to the pre-existing diagnosis. CrowdHealth is slightly more lenient on emergencies than some competitors. When considering a plan, ask specifically: 'What counts as emergency and will you cover it during waiting period?' Get the answer in writing.
### Why Don't ACA Plans Have Waiting Periods?
ACA plans are regulated by federal law and state insurance departments. Waiting periods are prohibited. Insurance companies must accept all applicants regardless of health and provide coverage starting the plan's effective date (no 30-day delay). This regulatory mandate protects consumers from exactly the gap health sharing creates. If you enroll in ACA on January 1, your coverage is active January 1—no exceptions. This certainty is part of why ACA plans are preferred for people with chronic conditions or anyone who might need care in their first 3 months.
### Can You Switch Plans Before a Waiting Period Ends?
Yes, but you lose your seniority with the previous organization. If you enroll in Health Sharing Plan A on January 1, get frustrated on February 15 (still during waiting period), and switch to Plan B, Plan B's waiting period starts fresh. You face another 30–90 day delay with no coverage. Worse: claims submitted during Plan A's waiting period remain Plan A's responsibility. Plan B won't retroactively cover them. Many people don't realize this and discover it when they try to leave. This is why waiting period timing matters—enroll during a healthy period when waiting period risk is low.
