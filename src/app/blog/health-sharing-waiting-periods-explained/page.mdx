        "text": "Depends on the condition and healthcare use. Examples: (1) Type 2 diabetes: $1,500-$2,500/year (medications, doctor visits); (2) Asthma: $800-$1,200/year (inhalers, urgent care); (3) Hypertension: $1,000-$1,800/year (medications, monitoring); (4) COPD: $2,000-$4,000/year (medications, respiratory therapy); (5) Arthritis: $500-$1,500/year (medications, physical therapy). A 12-month waiting period for a moderate chronic condition typically costs $1,200-$2,500 out-of-pocket."
      }
    }
  ]
};

Health sharing plans advertise low monthly costs—but there's a hidden price if you have a pre-existing condition: **waiting periods**.

A waiting period is when health sharing says "we won't cover your asthma, diabetes, or hypertension until 12 months after you enroll." You pay full price out-of-pocket while waiting. This is completely legal and standard across most health sharing plans.

But here's what's confusing: Some plans have waiting periods, some don't. And waiting periods don't apply to healthy people—only those with pre-existing conditions.

Let's break down exactly how waiting periods work and what they cost.

## What Gets Blocked During a Waiting Period?

When you join a health sharing plan with a pre-existing condition, here's what's covered vs. blocked:

**Blocked (you pay 100%):**
- Doctor visits related to the condition
- Medications for the condition
- Lab tests/imaging for the condition
- Specialist visits related to the condition
- ER visits related to the condition
- Procedures/surgeries for the condition

**Covered (plan shares):**
- Everything unrelated to that condition
- Preventive care (yearly physicals, vaccinations) if not condition-specific
- Routine bloodwork if unrelated to the condition

**Example: Jake has asthma and joins Medi-Share in February 2026**

| Claim Type | Covered? | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Asthma inhaler refill | NO | Directly related to asthma pre-existing condition |
| Doctor visit for asthma check-up | NO | Directly related to asthma pre-existing condition |
| ER visit for asthma attack | NO | Directly related to asthma pre-existing condition |
| Broken ankle (sports injury) | YES | New condition, unrelated to asthma |
| Yearly physical exam | YES | Preventive care, unrelated to asthma |
| Regular bloodwork | YES | Routine, not condition-specific |
| Sprained wrist | YES | New injury, unrelated to asthma |

Jake's asthma is blocked for 12 months (until February 2027), but his broken ankle and sports injuries are covered immediately.

## 5 Real Waiting Period Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Maria, Age 34, Type 2 Diabetes

**Maria's situation:**
- Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 3 years ago
- On metformin, atorvastatin, and blood pressure medication
- Wants to switch from ACA to health sharing to save money
- Joins Medi-Share in March 2026

**What Maria budgeted:**
- Medi-Share contribution: $185/month × 12 = $2,220/year

**What Maria actually paid (Year 1):**
- Monthly contributions: $2,220
- Diabetes care (out-of-pocket during 12-month waiting period):
  - Metformin refills: $600/year
  - Doctor visits (quarterly diabetes check-ups): $500/year
  - Lab tests (HbA1c, lipid panels): $400/year
  - Occasional ER visit for high blood sugar: $800/year
- **Total out-of-pocket year 1: $2,300**
- **Total year 1 cost: $4,520**

**After waiting period (Year 2):**
- Monthly contributions: $2,220
- Diabetes care (now covered by plan): $0 out-of-pocket
- **Total year 2 cost: $2,220**

**The waiting period cost:** Maria paid an extra $2,300 in year 1 that she wouldn't have paid on ACA insurance (which covers diabetes immediately). The "savings" of health sharing don't materialize until year 2.

---

### Scenario 2: James, Age 52, Hypertension + Anxiety (Two Pre-Existing Conditions)

**James's situation:**
- Diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (on lisinopril)
- Diagnosed with anxiety 4 years ago (on sertraline)
- Joins Zion HealthShare in January 2026
- Both conditions face 12-month waiting periods

**What James actually paid (Year 1):**
- Monthly contributions: $240 × 12 = $2,880

**Out-of-pocket costs during waiting periods:**
- Hypertension medications: $800/year
- Hypertension doctor visits: $400/year
- Anxiety medications: $600/year
- Anxiety therapy visits: $1,200/year (therapy is expensive without insurance!)
- **Total out-of-pocket year 1: $3,000**

**Total year 1 cost: $5,880**

**The impact:** James has TWO pre-existing conditions, so he's paying out-of-pocket for both throughout the year. Most people with one condition face high year-1 costs; James with two conditions faces VERY high year-1 costs. By year 2, he saves significantly, but year 1 is rough.

### Scenario 3: Sarah, Age 28, Pre-Diabetes (Questionable If Pre-Existing)

**Sarah's situation:**
- Pre-diabetes diagnosis (A1C of 5.9, no medication yet)
- Applies to CrowdHealth (which has NO waiting periods)
- Also applies to Medi-Share (which DOES have 12-month waiting period for "metabolic conditions")

**The difference:**
- **CrowdHealth:** Pre-diabetes covered immediately, no waiting period
- **Medi-Share:** Pre-diabetes subject to 12-month waiting period

**Sarah's dilemma:** Should she choose CrowdHealth (slightly higher cost, no waiting period) or Medi-Share (lower cost, 12-month waiting period for pre-diabetes management)?

**Cost comparison (Year 1):**
- CrowdHealth: $140/month = $1,680/year (full coverage)
- Medi-Share: $155/month + $400 out-of-pocket pre-diabetes costs = $2,260/year

**In this case, CrowdHealth is actually cheaper in year 1 because there's no waiting period cost.** Sarah should choose CrowdHealth.

---

### Scenario 4: Tom, Age 45, Cancer in Remission (3 Years Post-Treatment)

**Tom's situation:**
- Had colon cancer 3 years ago, completed treatment
- Now in remission, gets annual colonoscopy and bloodwork to monitor
- Applies to Zion HealthShare in June 2026

**The problem:** Zion classifies "history of cancer" as a pre-existing condition requiring a 12-month waiting period, even though Tom is in remission.

**What Tom actually paid (Year 1):**
- Monthly contributions: $260 × 12 = $3,120
- Post-cancer monitoring (out-of-pocket during waiting period):
  - Annual colonoscopy: $1,500
  - Oncology follow-up visits: $800
  - Lab tests/imaging surveillance: $600
- **Total out-of-pocket year 1: $2,900**
- **Total year 1 cost: $6,020**

**The unfairness:** Tom is in remission and healthy, yet he pays a waiting period penalty for his past cancer. Many members find this frustrating—the waiting period applies even when the condition is resolved. CrowdHealth is an exception: it has NO waiting periods, making it attractive to cancer survivors and others with resolved pre-existing conditions who want immediate coverage.

### Scenario 5: Elena, Age 29, No Pre-Existing Conditions (Healthy)

**Elena's situation:**
- No medical history, completely healthy
- Joins Medi-Share in January 2026
- Has routine preventive care but no chronic conditions

**What Elena paid (Year 1):**
- Monthly contributions: $125 × 12 = $1,500
- Out-of-pocket costs: $200 (routine doctor visit, physical exam)
- **Total year 1 cost: $1,700**

**Year 2+:**
- Monthly contributions: $1,500/year
- Out-of-pocket costs: ~$200/year (routine)
- **Total ongoing cost: $1,700/year**

**Elena's experience:** For healthy people, waiting periods don't apply—there's no cost penalty. Elena saves money immediately (vs. ACA at $250+/month) because she has no pre-existing conditions. This is why health sharing is so attractive to young, healthy people.

## Myths About Waiting Periods (Debunked)

**Myth 1: "Waiting Periods Only Apply to Diagnosed Conditions"**

False. Waiting periods apply to any condition you had symptoms for, were treated for, or took medication for within 5 years before enrollment—even if not formally diagnosed. Example: You had chronic back pain and took ibuprofen regularly (not diagnosed by a doctor) 2 years ago. Some plans might classify this as a pre-existing condition requiring a waiting period, even without a diagnosis.

---

**Myth 2: "Waiting Periods End After 12 Months No Matter What"**

True for MOST plans, but not all. Most plans have 6–12 month waiting periods, after which pre-existing conditions are covered. However, some plans have longer waiting periods for serious conditions (up to 24 months for certain cancers). Verify your plan's exact waiting period—it varies.

---

**Myth 3: "I Can Get a Waiting Period Waived if I Pay More"**

False. Waiting periods are not negotiable. You cannot pay extra to waive a waiting period. This is a fundamental difference from ACA insurance, which cannot impose waiting periods at all (they're illegal under the ACA). Some plans like CrowdHealth have no waiting periods; others have mandatory waiting periods for all members with pre-existing conditions.

---

**Myth 4: "Once a Waiting Period Ends, the Plan Covers All Related Conditions"**

Mostly true, but with exceptions. Once your diabetes waiting period ends (after 12 months), the plan covers diabetes-related care going forward. However, if you develop a complication (diabetic neuropathy, for example), the plan might classify the complication as a NEW condition requiring a new waiting period—depending on plan rules. This is rare but possible.

---

**Myth 5: "Waiting Periods Make Health Sharing Not Worth It"**

False for healthy people. For someone with zero pre-existing conditions, waiting periods are irrelevant—they save 40-50% vs. ACA immediately. For people WITH pre-existing conditions, waiting periods create a rough year 1, but year 2+ savings often make health sharing worthwhile. Example: Member pays $3,000 extra in year 1 due to waiting period, but saves $5,000+/year in years 2-5 due to lower contributions. It breaks even in year 1, then becomes profitable in year 2+.

## Waiting Period Strategy: When to Enroll

**If you have pre-existing conditions:**

**Strategy 1: Enroll at the start of the calendar year**
- Enrolling January 1 means your 12-month waiting period ends December 31 of the same year
- Benefit: Full coverage kicks in at the new year (helpful for New Year's resolutions, health goals)
- You endure 12 months of out-of-pocket costs

**Strategy 2: Enroll at start of a fiscal/financial year (when your tax year resets)**
- For self-employed, this might be January 1 or July 1 (if on fiscal year)
- Helps align waiting period end dates with your financial planning

**Strategy 3: Avoid enrolling if expecting major medical event soon**
- If you need surgery in 6 months and have a 12-month waiting period, don't enroll yet
- ACA insurance covers immediately; health sharing won't cover your surgery during the waiting period
- Wait until after the surgery to enroll in health sharing

**Strategy 4: Choose CrowdHealth if you have multiple pre-existing conditions**
- CrowdHealth has NO waiting periods
- Cost is higher ($140-$200/month), but no waiting period means you get full coverage immediately
- Worth the extra cost if you have 2+ pre-existing conditions

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>Can I switch health sharing plans to avoid a waiting period?</summary>

No. If you join any health sharing plan with a pre-existing condition, you have a waiting period. Switching to a different plan doesn't reset or waive it—the new plan will also impose a waiting period for the same condition. CrowdHealth is the only exception (no waiting periods), but you can't "game" the system by switching plans to avoid waiting periods.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if my pre-existing condition is well-controlled and I haven't needed treatment in 5 years?</summary>

Doesn't matter. The waiting period applies based on past diagnosis/treatment, not current status. If you were diagnosed with asthma 3 years ago and haven't used an inhaler in 2 years, asthma is still a pre-existing condition with a waiting period. The plan's definition is: "ever diagnosed within X years," not "currently symptomatic."

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I negotiate with the plan to shorten my waiting period?</summary>

Not with most plans. CrowdHealth and a few others have standard waiting period policies with no negotiation. However, some plans (like Christian Healthcare Ministries) have case-by-case review processes if you have extenuating circumstances. Call your plan to ask—it doesn't hurt, but don't expect the waiting period to be waived.

</details>

<details>
<summary>If I'm on ACA and have my pre-existing condition covered, can I switch to health sharing without a waiting period?</summary>

No. ACA coverage doesn't exempt you from health sharing waiting periods. Regardless of prior insurance, if you enroll in health sharing with a pre-existing condition, you'll have a waiting period for that condition. ACA's prohibition on waiting periods doesn't extend to health sharing plans.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do pregnancy-related waiting periods exist in health sharing?</summary>

Yes, in some plans. If you're pregnant when you enroll, some plans treat pregnancy as a pre-existing condition with a waiting period (preventing coverage of maternity care). Example: You're 5 months pregnant and enroll in Medi-Share. Your maternity care might not be covered because it's a "pre-existing condition" (pregnancy). Always check plan rules before enrolling if pregnant.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I have multiple pre-existing conditions—do they all have the same waiting period?</summary>

Usually yes, but not always. Most plans have a standard 12-month waiting period for all pre-existing conditions. However, some conditions might have longer waiting periods (cancer: 24 months in some plans) or shorter periods (arthritis: 6 months in some plans). Each condition has its own waiting period clock—if you join with diabetes and asthma, both start their waiting periods on your enrollment date.
