One of the biggest surprises for health sharing members is the annual assessment—an unexpected mid-year charge that increases your cost 10–30% beyond the advertised monthly contribution.

Most people sign up thinking "I pay $240/month," only to discover in July they owe an additional $200 assessment. Understanding annual assessments and how to budget for them is essential.

## What Is an Annual Assessment?

An annual assessment is an extra charge passed to members when the health sharing pool's claims exceed contributions.

Here's how it works:

1. **January–June:** Members pay monthly contributions ($240/month = $1,440 contributed)
2. **January–June:** Claims are filed and paid by the pool ($2,100 in claims paid)
3. **Shortfall:** Pool is short $660 (claims $2,100 vs. contributions $1,440)
4. **July Assessment:** Members are charged proportionally—maybe $110 extra per member
5. **Member's new cost:** $240/month + $110 assessment = $350/month for remainder of year

**Key point:** The assessment is NOT optional. You enrolled in a health sharing community; if the pool is short, members cover it proportionally.

## Which Plans Have Assessments?

**Plans WITH potential assessments (variable costs):**
- Medi-Share: Yes, typically $50–$300/year assessments (history of high assessments)
- Aliera: Some plans yes, some no (depends on tier)
- CrowdHealth: No regular assessments (built into fixed contributions)
- Liberty Health Share: Yes, occasional assessments (rare but possible)

**Plans WITHOUT assessments (fixed contributions):**
- CrowdHealth: Fixed contributions, no assessments
- Some Aliera tiers: No-assessment options available
- Christian Brotherhood: Fixed (no assessments)

**Bottom line:** Ask explicitly: "Does this plan have annual assessments? What was last year's assessment?"

## Real-World Assessment Impact Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Sarah, 32, CrowdHealth ($190/month)**
- Advertised cost: $190 × 12 = $2,280/year
- CrowdHealth policy: NO assessments
- Actual cost: $2,280
- Assessment surprise: $0
- **Predictable budget; no mid-year surprises**

---

**Scenario 2: Marcus, 45, Aliera ($280/month, No-Assessment Plan)**
- Advertised cost: $280 × 12 = $3,360/year
- Plan policy: No-assessment tier (higher base contribution)
- Actual cost: $3,360 (guaranteed)
- Assessment surprise: $0
- Why higher base cost: Assessments rolled into fixed monthly contribution
- **Trade-off: Pay slightly more monthly to avoid assessment surprise**

---

**Scenario 3: Jennifer, 38, Medi-Share ($320/month)**
- Advertised cost: $320 × 12 = $3,840/year
- Actual contributions: $3,840
- Mid-year assessment (July): $240 charged to all members
- Revised cost: $3,840 + $240 = $4,080
- Effective monthly cost: $340/month (not $320)
- Assessment as % of base: $240 ÷ $3,840 = 6.25% increase
- **Budget surprise: Planned $320/month, paid $340/month reality**

---

**Scenario 4: David, 50, Medi-Share ($420/month, Bad Claims Year)**
- Advertised cost: $420 × 12 = $5,040/year
- Normal years: ~$150 assessment
- 2026 (bad claims year): $380 assessment (unusually high)
- Actual cost: $5,040 + $380 = $5,420
- Effective monthly cost: $452/month (not $420)
- Assessment as % of base: $380 ÷ $5,040 = 7.5% increase
- **Surprise: $380 bill in July; budget already tight**

---

**Scenario 5: Lisa, 55, Liberty Health Share ($310/month, Multiple Years)**
- Year 1: $310 × 12 + $50 assessment = $3,770 total
- Year 2: $310 × 12 + $120 assessment = $3,840 total
- Year 3: $310 × 12 + $0 assessment = $3,720 total
- Average over 3 years: $3,777/year (vs. advertised $3,720)
- Long-term forecast: Plan for $3,750–$3,850/year (not $3,720)
- **Assessment trends: Some years high, some low; average is higher than advertised**

## How to Forecast Your True Annual Cost

**Method 1: Look Up Plan History**
1. Contact plan: "What were the assessments for the past 3 years?"
2. Calculate average: (Assessment Y1 + Y2 + Y3) ÷ 3
3. Add to base: Monthly contribution × 12 + average assessment

**Example:**
- Medi-Share history: $150 (Y1), $240 (Y2), $180 (Y3)
- Average: ($150 + $240 + $180) ÷ 3 = $190
- Base cost: $320/month × 12 = $3,840
- **True annual cost forecast: $3,840 + $190 = $4,030** (vs. advertised $3,840)

**Method 2: Industry Average**
- Health sharing average assessment: 5–12% of annual contributions
- If paying $300/month ($3,600/year), forecast assessment: $180–$432
- True cost estimate: $3,600 + $300 = $3,900 (using 8% average)

**Method 3: Conservative Budgeting**
- Always add 15% buffer to advertised contribution
- Advertised: $300/month = $3,600/year
- True budget: $3,600 × 1.15 = $4,140/year (accounting for assessments)
- Monthly allocation: $345/month budgeted (not $300)

## Common Myths About Annual Assessments

**Myth 1: Annual assessments are rare and won't happen to me**
False. Most plans WITH assessments charge them 70–80% of years. Medi-Share especially charges annual assessments regularly.

**Myth 2: If I have few claims, I won't pay assessments**
False. Assessments are pool-wide. Even with zero claims, you pay assessments if the entire pool is short.

**Myth 3: Assessments are optional; I can refuse to pay**
False. When you enroll, assessments are part of the agreement. Non-payment can result in membership suspension or cancellation.

**Myth 4: I can budget $240/month and know that's my total cost**
False. If assessments exist, your true cost is $240/month + assessment (usually $100–$300 mid-year).

**Myth 5: High-assessment years mean I should switch plans**
Not necessarily. Switching plans resets waiting periods and creates plan change costs. Sometimes it's cheaper to absorb the assessment than switch.

**Myth 6: Assessment history doesn't predict future assessments**
False. Plans with history of $150–$200 assessments will likely continue. Use past data to forecast future costs.

## How to Choose: Assessment vs. No-Assessment Plans

**Prefer NO-ASSESSMENT plans if:**
- You want budget predictability
- You're on a tight monthly budget
- You dislike surprises
- You value simplicity

**Acceptable ASSESSMENT plans if:**
- You can absorb $100–$300 mid-year surprise
- You want lower base monthly contribution
- Plan history shows assessments <10% of annual cost

## FAQ: Assessment Details and Logistics

<details>
<summary>Can I appeal or negotiate a refund if an assessment is too high?</summary>
No. Assessments are binding once charged. You cannot negotiate, appeal, or request refund. Your only recourse is to cancel membership (which resets waiting periods if you switch to another plan).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I can't afford the mid-year assessment?</summary>
Contact the plan immediately. Most plans allow payment plans (spread assessment over 2–3 months) rather than lump-sum billing. Confirm before enrolling whether payment plan options exist.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do assessments appear on your credit report if unpaid?</summary>
Not typically, but non-payment results in membership suspension. You lose coverage immediately if assessment isn't paid. Health sharing plans don't use collection agencies like insurance; they simply cancel you.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can a plan suddenly announce huge assessments mid-year?</summary>
Technically yes, but rare. Most plans cap assessments (max $500–$1,000/year). Some announce estimates in January. Read fine print about assessment caps and timing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If I'm on a family plan, is the assessment per person or total?</summary>
Usually per membership unit (family is 1 unit). So a family plan's assessment applies once, not per family member. Confirm with your specific plan.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do assessments affect my 10-year cost forecast?</summary>
Add average assessment × 10 years to your calculation. If assessment averages $200/year, add $2,000 to your 10-year forecast. This changes cost comparisons significantly.
</details>

## Budgeting for Health Sharing with Assessments

**Sample Budget for $300/month contribution with $150/year assessment:**
- January–June: $300/month = $1,800
- July (assessment month): $300 + $25 (assessment divided) = $325
- August–December: $300/month = $1,500
- **Total year: $5,125 (vs. advertised $3,600)**
- **True cost: $427/month average (not $300)**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Annual assessments can increase your cost 5–15%** – Budget conservatively
2. **Not all plans have assessments** – CrowdHealth and some Aliera tiers don't
3. **Historical assessments predict future assessments** – Ask for plan history before enrolling
4. **Assessments are mid-year surprises** – Budget buffer or choose no-assessment plans
5. **True cost = base contribution + average assessment** – Don't compare advertised costs; compare true costs

Don't let annual assessments blindside you. Ask your plan directly about assessment history, call the membership team, and factor them into your annual budget.
