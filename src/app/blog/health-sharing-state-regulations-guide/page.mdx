Health sharing's legal status varies wildly by state. In most places, it's fully legal and unregulated. In a few states, it's banned entirely. Understanding your state's rules before enrolling is essential—otherwise, you might think you're covered when you're not.

## The Bottom Line: 48 Legal, 2 Illegal

**Health sharing is legal in:** 48 states + DC
**Health sharing is illegal in:** New York, Texas

That said, within those 48 states, regulations and requirements vary significantly.

## States That BAN Health Sharing Entirely

### New York
- **Status:** BANNED (effective 2015)
- **Why:** New York considers all health sharing plans to be insurance; only state-regulated insurance is legal
- **Alternatives:** ACA, short-term insurance, employer plans
- **No exceptions:** Religious exemption does NOT apply in New York
- **Enforcement:** Health sharing plans have no operations in New York; enrollment is illegal

### Texas
- **Status:** BANNED (effective 2009)
- **Why:** Texas Insurance Code prohibits health sharing unless properly licensed as insurance
- **Alternatives:** ACA, short-term insurance, employer plans
- **Religious exemption:** Exists for ACA mandate but does NOT allow health sharing
- **Enforcement:** Health sharing plans do not operate in Texas; membership violates state law
- **Note:** Religious organizations can operate their own cost-sharing programs under strict Texas rules

## States With Partial or Conditional Restrictions

### California
- **Status:** RESTRICTED (some plans allowed, others not)
- **Rules:** Only faith-based health sharing plans with >1000 members allowed; requires state notification
- **Allowed plans:** Medi-Share (registered), Aliera (limited), some others
- **Restricted:** CrowdHealth may face restrictions; verify before enrolling
- **Disclosure:** Plans must disclose they are not insurance (California-specific requirement)

### Illinois
- **Status:** RESTRICTED (religious exemption only)
- **Rules:** Only plans requiring Christian faith or worldview permitted
- **Secular plans:** Not allowed; Aliera may not be available
- **Documentation:** May require proof of faith affiliation

### Massachusetts
- **Status:** RESTRICTED (religious exemption only)
- **Rules:** Very strict; only faith-based plans with clear religious mission allowed
- **Available:** Limited; verify plan availability with provider

### New Hampshire
- **Status:** RESTRICTED (religious exemption only)
- **Rules:** Only faith-based plans allowed; non-religious plans cannot operate
- **Allowed:** Medi-Share, Aliera (religious tier); CrowdHealth may not be available

## States With Full Legal Status (Most Permissive)

### Federal Exemption States
- **Status:** FULLY LEGAL with federal religious exemption
- **Regulation:** Unregulated (exempt from insurance laws)
- **Requirements:** Minimal; often just health questionnaire
- **States:** 38+ states including:
  - Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado (limited), Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

## Religious Affiliation Requirements by Plan

## 2026 Regulatory Changes & New Requirements

### CMS Disclosure Requirements (Federal, All States)

As of 2026, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded disclosure rules:

1. **"Not Insurance" Statement** – Plans must clearly disclose they are NOT health insurance, NOT regulated by state insurance commissioners, and NOT subject to ACA requirements

2. **Waiting Period Disclosure** – Plans must clearly state 30–60 day waiting periods upfront

3. **Coverage Limits** – Plans must disclose per-incident caps, annual sharing caps, and exclusions

4. **Claim Denial Transparency** – Plans must disclose typical denial rates and grounds for denial

5. **Financial Stability Disclosure** – Plans must state they have no solvency guarantees (unlike insurance)

**Impact:** Health sharing plans are more transparent but still not regulated as insurance.

### State-Level Trends (2024–2026)

- **New regulations:** No major new bans proposed for 2026; health sharing remains federally exempted
- **Disclosure momentum:** More states may require transparency disclosures similar to CMS rules
- **Faith-based debate:** Some states revisiting religious exemption rules (but no changes yet in 2026)

## Practical Implications by State

### If You Live in NY or TX

**No health sharing available.**
- Options: ACA, short-term insurance, employer plans
- Religious exemption doesn't apply to health sharing in these states
- If you move to a health sharing state, you can enroll

### If You Live in Restricted States (CA, IL, MA, NH)

**Limited options; faith requirement may apply.**
- Check plan availability directly—your state may restrict even ACA-friendly plans
- Aliera or CrowdHealth may have limited availability
- Verify state-specific enrollment before committing

### If You Live in Allowed States (38+)

**Full legal status; most plans available.**
- Aliera, CrowdHealth, Medi-Share all operate
- Faith is optional or required depending on plan choice
- Minimal state regulation; federal exemption applies

## How to Verify Your State's Rules

1. **Contact the plan directly:**
   - "Is health sharing available in [YOUR STATE]?"
   - "What are enrollment requirements for [YOUR STATE]?"
   - "Are there state-specific waiting periods or restrictions?"

2. **Check your state's insurance commissioner website:**
   - Search "[STATE] health sharing" on the commissioner's site
   - Look for FAQs or regulatory guidance

3. **Review the plan's state-by-state policy:**
   - Plans publish which states they operate in
   - Read the state-specific disclosure addendum

## Common Myths About State Regulations

**Myth 1: Health sharing is banned everywhere in strict insurance states**
False. New York and Texas are the only true bans. Other strict states allow health sharing under religious exemption.

**Myth 2: If I move states, my health sharing membership automatically transfers**
False. You must enroll in the plan for your new state. Some states may have waiting periods or restrictions that apply.

**Myth 3: Religious exemptions allow any health sharing plan in any state**
False. Some states (CA, IL, MA, NH) restrict even faith-based plans. Religious exemption helps but doesn't guarantee access.

**Myth 4: Health sharing is regulated by state insurance commissioners**
False. Health sharing is federally exempt from insurance regulation. States can restrict it, but they don't regulate it like insurance.

**Myth 5: New states will ban health sharing like NY and TX did**
False. No major states have banned health sharing since Texas (2009). The trend is acceptance, not bans.

**Myth 6: State regulations don't affect plan availability or terms**
False. State rules directly affect which plans operate where and what terms they offer.

## FAQ: State-Specific Questions

<details>
<summary>If I'm in a restricted state, can I enroll in a health sharing plan from another state?</summary>
Not legally. Your state's rules apply based on residence. Enrolling in an out-of-state plan when your state bans health sharing is illegal. You must live in an allowed state to legally enroll.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I'm moving to a new state soon?</summary>
Plan your enrollment for your new state. If moving to a banned state (NY/TX), cancel before the move. If moving to an allowed state, enroll after establishing residency.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to notify my plan if I move to a new state?</summary>
Yes. Contact your plan and update your address. Some plans may require re-enrollment or state-specific terms. Don't assume your membership automatically transfers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If my state bans health sharing after I've enrolled, am I grandfathered in?</summary>
Unlikely. If a state bans health sharing, existing members are typically given a grace period (30–90 days) to find alternative coverage. Not a true grandfathering.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I travel to other states while on a health sharing plan from my home state?</summary>
Yes. Your membership remains valid while traveling. However, if you move permanently (change residency), state rules apply.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I enroll in a plan that's later banned in my state?</summary>
Contact the plan immediately. You'll receive notice and a grace period to switch to ACA or another option. Plans handle this as a business transition, not a penalty to members.
</details>

## Key Takeaways

1. **Health sharing is legal in 48 states** – NY and TX are the only exceptions
