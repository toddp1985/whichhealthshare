The health sharing market is dominated by Christian ministries, but four mainstream secular options exist as of 2026, with Zion HealthShare (which dropped its faith requirement in January 2026) serving as the largest non-religious option at 35,000 members, while CrowdHealth (15,000 members, crowdfunding model), Sedera (8,000 members, $500K cap), and OneShare Health (5,000 members, tech-forward) provide alternatives for people who want cost savings without faith-based community.

## The Secular Health Sharing Landscape (2026)

| Plan | Members | Monthly Cost | Pre-existing Wait | Coverage Cap | Best For |
|------|---------|------|-------|---|---|
| **Zion HealthShare** | 35K | $185–$268 | Immediate | $250K | Largest non-religious option; immediate pre-existing coverage |
| **CrowdHealth** | 15K | $140 + 30–43% fees | 1 year (phased) | None | No caps; crowdfunding model; growing fast |
| **Sedera** | 8K | $180–$280 | 6 months | $500K | Highest coverage cap; explicitly secular since founding |
| **OneShare Health** | 5K | $160–$300 | 6 months | $100K | Tech-forward platform; secular focus |
| **HSA Secure** | 2K (pilot) | $185–$320 | Varies | Varies | HSA-eligible hybrid; secular; 28 states |

## Option 1: Zion HealthShare — The Game Changer for Secular Members

**The news:** Zion HealthShare dropped its faith requirement effective January 2026.

This is the biggest shift in health sharing's secular landscape in years. Zion was founded in 1981 as a faith-based ministry but realized its strongest competitive advantage—immediate pre-existing condition coverage—was being wasted on members who couldn't even join due to faith requirements.

**What changed:**
- Faith statement requirement eliminated
- Lifestyle guidelines softened (tobacco users now accepted at higher rates)
- All other features remain: $185–$268/month, $250K cap, day-1 pre-existing coverage

**Why this matters:**
Zion is now the largest secular health sharing option by far. 35,000 members, proven 40+ year track record, standardized processes, and transparent data. For a secular person who wants traditional health sharing without faith complications, Zion is the obvious starting point.

**Real-world advantage:**
A person with Type 2 diabetes joining Zion pays $185–$268/month + eligible medication costs (shared by plan) from day 1. Same person joining a faith-based plan? 6–12 month waiting period = $1,800–$3,600 out of pocket before coverage starts.

**The caveat:**
$250K coverage cap. If you have a major medical event exceeding $250,000, you're liable for the overage. For catastrophic risk, CrowdHealth (no cap) is safer.

<CalloutBox type="crowdhealth">
**Want unlimited coverage without faith?** [CrowdHealth has no per-incident caps](/reviews/crowdhealth) and dropped the faith requirement entirely. The trade is the crowdfunding model (voluntary contributions) instead of pooled obligation.
</CalloutBox>

## Option 2: CrowdHealth — The Crowdfunding Alternative

CrowdHealth isn't a health sharing ministry—it's a healthcare crowdfunding platform. The difference matters.

**How it works:**
- You join and pay $35–$40/month as an "advocate fee" (operational cost)
- When you have a medical event, you submit the bill
- Other members review and choose whether to contribute
- Most cases get 100% funding, but there's no guarantee
- If contributions fall short, you pay the gap

**Why secular people choose it:**
- No faith requirement
- No religious community requirements
- No lifestyle restrictions (except no tobacco users)
- No coverage caps (a $2M surgery gets shared if members contribute)
- Growing fast (15,000 members, up from 5,000 in 2023)

**The trade:**
Contributions are voluntary, not guaranteed. In rare cases, a claim might get 80% funding instead of 100%. Plus, you pay 30–43% "advisory fees" on any claim amount—CrowdHealth's operational cost structure.

**Real-world math:**
- Zero claims year: $140/month = $1,680/year (cheapest option)
- One $5,000 claim: $140 × 12 + ($5,000 × 35–43%) = $1,680 + $1,750–$2,150 = $3,430–$3,830
- Multiple chronic claims: Fees compound, making CrowdHealth more expensive than traditional health sharing

**For whom:**
Healthy secular people, people under 35, and people who file zero-to-few claims. For someone with chronic illness, traditional health sharing (Zion, Sedera) is cheaper.

**Secular appeal:**
CrowdHealth markets itself as secular and community-focused (not faith-based community). Members contribute based on mutual aid, not religious obligation. This resonates with secular people who like the idea of community healthcare without religious framing.

## Option 3: Sedera — The Explicitly Secular Specialist

Sedera is the only health sharing ministry explicitly founded on secular principles. Since its inception (~2010), it's marketed to non-religious members.

**Sedera's positioning:**
- Secular values (not faith-based)
- Transparent processes
- $500K coverage cap (highest in the market)
- 6-month pre-existing condition wait
- $180–$280/month

**Why it matters:**
If you want "traditional" health sharing (pooled monthly contributions, coverage guarantees, clear guidelines) but don't want any faith framing or community, Sedera is your match.

**The caveat:**
Sedera is small (8,000 members) compared to Zion (35,000) or Medi-Share (500,000). Smaller pools carry risk—if a severe medical event year hits and claims exceed contributions, reimbursements could be delayed or reduced. No small health sharing plan has failed yet, but the risk exists.

For someone prioritizing stability, Zion's size is an advantage. For someone prioritizing secular values, Sedera's explicit market positioning is an advantage.

**The appeal:**
Sedera members report feeling "on the same wavelength" with other members—secular, pragmatic, community-minded without religious identity. This social fit matters to some people.

## Option 4: OneShare Health — The Tech-Forward Secular Option

OneShare Health is newer (founded ~2021) but has gained traction among tech-savvy, secular health sharing shoppers.

**OneShare's features:**
- Explicitly non-religious
- Mobile app-first member experience
- Transparent claim tracking
- $160–$300/month
- 6-month pre-existing wait
- $100K coverage cap (lowest in the market)

**Why secular people like it:**
Better user experience than traditional ministries. OneShare's app lets you track claims, communicate with other members, and manage your account entirely on mobile. Sedera and Zion's interfaces feel more dated by comparison.

**The trade:**
Smallest cap in the market ($100K). For someone with modest medical expenses, fine. For catastrophic risk, problematic.

Also the newest with least historical data (founded ~2021, only ~5K members). If stability matters, OneShare is riskier than Zion or even Sedera.

**When to choose it:**
You're under 40, healthy, tech-savvy, prioritize user experience, and don't want faith-based community. OneShare works well as a cost-saving experiment. If you need long-term stability, Zion is safer.

## Option 5: HSA Secure — The Hybrid Secular Option

HSA Secure (expanded to 28 states in 2026) is technically insurance-adjacent, not health sharing, but it's the only option that combines secular values with HSA eligibility.

**How it works:**
- You get an HDHP-equivalent plan ($2,000–$4,000 deductible)
- Above the deductible, pooled cost-sharing (health sharing-like model)
- Full HSA eligibility ($4,300/year tax-deductible)
- $185–$320/month

**Secular advantage:**
HSA Secure is explicitly non-religious and designed for people who want health sharing benefits (low cost, pooled model) but also want HSA tax advantages and insurance-level oversight.

**The limitation:**
Only available in 28 states as a pilot. If you're outside those states, HSA Secure isn't an option yet.

## Comparing the Secular Options: A Decision Matrix

**If you prioritize: Stability & Size**
→ Choose **Zion** (35K members, 40-year track record, immediate pre-existing coverage)

**If you prioritize: No Coverage Caps**
→ Choose **CrowdHealth** (unlimited coverage, but voluntary contributions)

**If you prioritize: Explicitly Secular Values**
→ Choose **Sedera** (founded on secular principles, $500K cap)

**If you prioritize: User Experience & Tech**
→ Choose **OneShare Health** (best mobile app, but smallest cap)

**If you prioritize: HSA Tax Benefits + Secular**
→ Choose **HSA Secure** (if available in your state)

## Why Secular Health Sharing Is Growing (And Why It Still Matters)

Until 2026, secular people had almost no health sharing options. Medi-Share, CHM, and Samaritan all required faith. Smaller plans existed but felt fringe.

Zion's faith requirement drop changes this. Suddenly, secular people can access the largest stable health sharing option without compromise.

This matters because:

1. **Cost advantage for secular people.** Instead of choosing between faith-based health sharing or expensive ACA insurance, secular people now have cost-competitive options (Zion, Sedera, CrowdHealth) without identity compromise.

2. **Growth signals.** CrowdHealth's growth (5K→15K members in 3 years) and HSA Secure's expansion (pilot→28 states) show investor confidence in secular healthcare sharing models.

3. **Competition pushes quality.** The existence of secular competitors pushes even faith-based plans (Zion adopted this first) to be more inclusive and transparent.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose Zion if** you want the largest, most stable secular health sharing option with immediate pre-existing coverage. Trade: $250K cap.

**Choose CrowdHealth if** you want unlimited caps and don't mind the crowdfunding model (voluntary contributions). Trade: No coverage guarantees.

**Choose Sedera if** you want explicitly secular-founded health sharing with a high cap ($500K). Trade: Smaller member base, less historical data.

**Choose OneShare if** you prioritize tech-forward user experience. Trade: Smallest cap ($100K), newest provider.

**Choose HSA Secure if** you want secular health sharing with HSA tax benefits. Trade: Only available in 28 states.

All of these avoid faith requirements, lifestyle restrictions, and community obligations that turn many secular people away from traditional health sharing.
