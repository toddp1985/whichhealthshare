ACA plans must cover pre-existing conditions with no exclusions or waiting periods under the Affordable Care Act, while health sharing plans typically impose 12–24 month waiting periods before covering pre-existing condition claims. As of Feb 2026, if you have diabetes, heart disease, or asthma, an ACA plan is your only guaranteed path to immediate coverage.

## Your Key Questions Answered

### Why Don't ACA Plans Exclude Pre-Existing Conditions?
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 banned insurance companies from excluding anyone for pre-existing conditions or charging higher premiums based on health status. This protection is enforced by federal law and state insurance departments—violation carries penalties up to $100 per person per day. Health sharing plans, however, are exempt from ACA rules because they're classified as religious or community-based ministries, not insurance. This legal distinction means health sharing can impose waiting periods that ACA cannot.
### What Happens During the Waiting Period?
During a health sharing waiting period for pre-existing conditions, you cannot submit claims for care related to that condition. If you have Type 2 diabetes and enroll in health sharing with a 24-month waiting period, all diabetes-related doctor visits, medications, and complications are your responsibility. Emergency room visits for diabetic complications may be covered if deemed 'acute' rather than 'chronic,' but this varies by plan and claim reviewers. The financial burden remains yours until the waiting period ends.
### Can I Get Immediate Coverage for Pre-Existing Conditions Anywhere?
Only ACA plans guarantee immediate coverage for all pre-existing conditions at day-one enrollment. Traditional health insurance (not offered through ACA marketplaces) may also cover pre-existing conditions immediately, depending on the policy and your state. Health sharing plans will never offer this—waiting periods are fundamental to their model. Medicare covers pre-existing conditions from day one. If you have an urgent pre-existing condition diagnosis, ACA is your only option in 2026.
### How Do Health Sharing Plans Define 'Pre-Existing'?
Health sharing plans define pre-existing conditions as any diagnosis, treatment, or symptom you had before enrolling. Some plans use a lookback period (e.g., 'any condition treated in the past 12 months'), while others look back further. A few plans use a stricter definition: if you saw a doctor, took medication, or received a diagnosis for anything in the past 2 years, it's pre-existing. CrowdHealth and other transparent plans publish their exact definition upfront; others are vague until you claim. This variation makes it critical to read the fine print before enrolling.
### What If My Condition Gets Worse During the Waiting Period?
If your pre-existing condition worsens during the waiting period, health sharing plans typically deny coverage for the worsening condition as well. Example: If you have a pre-existing asthma diagnosis with a 24-month waiting period and develop respiratory failure after 18 months, the organization can deny or partially deny the claim as a 'progression of pre-existing illness.' Some plans offer emergency-only coverage during waiting periods, but routine complications are excluded. ACA plans cover all complications from day one, regardless of when the condition started.
### Are There Any Health Sharing Plans Without Pre-Existing Waiting Periods?
As of Feb 2026, no major health sharing organization has eliminated pre-existing condition waiting periods entirely. The waiting period is a defining feature of health sharing economics—without it, adverse selection would drain membership pools. However, a few organizations offer shortened waiting periods (6–12 months instead of 24) for some conditions. CrowdHealth and Samaritan Ministries are competitive on transparency here. If you have a pre-existing condition and want coverage without waiting, ACA is your only option. Health sharing is never recommended as a first choice for people with active medical conditions.
