Pre-existing conditions are the elephant in the room with health sharing plans. Unlike ACA insurance, which must cover them from day one, health sharing plans can exclude or delay coverage for conditions you had before enrollment.

This is a critical issue: If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or past heart problems, the wrong health sharing plan can leave you paying for medications and doctor visits out-of-pocket for months.

Here's what you need to know before enrolling.

## What Counts as "Pre-Existing"

A pre-existing condition is any health issue diagnosed or treated before your health sharing enrollment date. This includes:

- **Definitely pre-existing:**
  - Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (even if well-controlled)
  - Hypertension/high blood pressure (even on medication)
  - Past heart attack or stroke
  - Cancer (current or in remission)
  - Arthritis or joint disease
  - Asthma (even if mild)
  - Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder
  - COPD or emphysema
  - Kidney disease
  - Liver disease
  - Any past surgery (even if fully healed)

- **Unclear/debated:**
  - Controlled cholesterol (no other diagnosis)
  - Seasonal allergies
  - Occasional back pain (no formal diagnosis)
  - Reflux (no formal diagnosis)
  - Migraines (depends on frequency and treatment)

The safest assumption: If a doctor diagnosed it or treated it, it's pre-existing.

## Waiting Periods by Plan

**6-Month Waiting Period (Most Common)**
- CrowdHealth: 6 months for most pre-existing conditions
- Aliera: 6 months for pre-existing conditions
- Good news: 6 months is manageable; you're covered by month 7
- Bad news: Prescription medications are not covered during 6 months

**12-Month Waiting Period (Stricter)**
- Medi-Share: 12 months for serious conditions (diabetes, heart disease, cancer)
- Aliera (some plans): 12 months for high-risk conditions
- Serious implication: If you enroll in February, December of the same year you're still in waiting period

**No Coverage/Lifetime Exclusion (Rare)**
- Some older plans or specific conditions: Permanent exclusion
- Example: Previous cancer diagnosis might be excluded for any cancer-related claim for life
- This is why comparing plans carefully matters

## Real-World Pre-Existing Condition Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Marcus, 46, Type 2 Diabetes (Metformin 500mg twice daily)**
- Monthly insulin/medication cost: $120
- Health sharing plan: Medi-Share (12-month pre-existing waiting period)
- Enrollment: February 2026
- Coverage gap: February 2026 – January 2027 (full year), Marcus pays 100% for diabetes care
- Out-of-pocket during waiting period: $120 × 12 = $1,440
- After 12 months: Coverage starts February 2027
- Trade-off: $320/month health sharing vs. $680/month insurance, but loses 12 months of medication coverage
- Net cost: $320 × 12 + $1,440 = $5,280 (vs. $8,160 insurance)
- **Saves $2,880 but requires 1-year medication funding**

**Scenario 2: Jennifer, 42, High Blood Pressure (Lisinopril, Well-Controlled)**
- Monthly medication cost: $30 (generic)
- Health sharing plan: CrowdHealth (6-month waiting period)
- Enrollment: February 2026
- Coverage gap: February – July 2026 (6 months)
- Out-of-pocket during waiting period: $30 × 6 = $180
- After 6 months: Full coverage starts August
- Trade-off: $240/month health sharing vs. $420/month insurance
- Net cost: $240 × 12 + $180 = $3,060
- **Saves $2,880 with only $180 out-of-pocket medication cost—manageable**

**Scenario 3: Robert, 58, History of Heart Attack (2017, 5 Years Ago)**
- Current: On aspirin, statin (cholesterol), beta-blocker for heart health
- Monthly medication cost: $45
- Health sharing plan: Aliera (6-month cardiac condition waiting period)
- Coverage gap: 6 months for cardiac medications
- Out-of-pocket: $45 × 6 = $270
- Big issue: If Robert has chest pain during waiting period, is it covered?
  - If cardiac (pre-existing): DENIED
  - If something else: Might be covered
  - Uncertainty creates serious risk
- Insurance is safer for Robert; health sharing carries risk of emergencies during exclusion

**Scenario 4: Lisa, 35, Depression (Diagnosed 10 Years Ago, Now in Remission, No Meds)**
- Current medication: None (successfully discontinued 3 years ago)
- Health sharing plan: Medi-Share (excludes mental health)
- Coverage issue: Even though Lisa is no longer depressed, mental health is excluded
- If depression returns: Zero coverage for therapy or medication
- Implication: Lisa can't use health sharing safely (no mental health coverage during relapse)
- Better choice: Stay on insurance for mental health coverage flexibility

**Scenario 5: David, 52, Asthma (Mild, Occasional Inhaler)**
- Monthly medication cost: $15 (rescue inhaler refills ~$50 every 3 months = $200/year)
- Health sharing plan: CrowdHealth (6-month asthma waiting period)
- Coverage gap: 6 months
- Out-of-pocket: $200 × 6 ÷ 12 = $100 during waiting period
- Risk: If severe asthma attack during waiting period: ER visit NOT covered, costs $2,000+
- David's decision: Accept $100 medication cost + $2,000 potential ER risk
- Better decision: Insurance is safer for any condition with emergency risk

## Common Myths About Pre-Existing Conditions

**Myth 1: If my condition is well-controlled, I don't have to disclose it**
False. Controlled conditions are still pre-existing. Whether you're currently sick or not doesn't matter—the condition history does.

**Myth 2: Health sharing must cover pre-existing conditions like insurance does**
False. Health sharing is not regulated like insurance. They can legally exclude or waiting-period pre-existing conditions.

**Myth 3: After the waiting period, all treatment from the condition is covered**
False. Some plans cover the condition after waiting period, others have lifetime exclusions. Read your enrollment carefully.

**Myth 4: If I stop taking medication before enrollment, the condition disappears**
False. Discontinuing medication doesn't erase diagnosis. The condition remains pre-existing and waiting periods apply.

**Myth 5: I can enroll before diagnosis to avoid pre-existing classification**
This doesn't work and is risky. If you enroll with undiagnosed high blood pressure and it's discovered later, you face retroactive exclusions or enrollment cancellation.

**Myth 6: Mental health conditions are covered after the waiting period**
Often false. Mental health is frequently excluded entirely from health sharing plans. Some plans don't cover it even after waiting periods.

## How to Know If Health Sharing Is Right With Your Conditions

**Ask these specific questions before enrolling:**

1. **"Does my condition have a waiting period? If yes, how long?"**
   - If 6 months or less: Manageable for most
   - If 12 months: Significant gap, weigh carefully
   - If unlimited/excluded: Don't enroll in this plan

2. **"After the waiting period, what exactly is covered?"**
   - Ask about medications, doctor visits, specialist care, surgery, testing
   - Get this in writing—don't trust verbal promises

3. **"Are there any lifetime caps or exclusions for this condition?"**
   - If yes, plan doesn't work for you

4. **"What's your typical claim denial rate for people with this condition?"**
   - Ask for specific data; if vague response, red flag

5. **"Can I appeal a denial for treatment related to this condition?"**
   - Understand appeal process before enrolling

## FAQ: Pre-Existing Coverage Specifics

<details>
<summary>If I have multiple pre-existing conditions, do I apply waiting periods to each one?</summary>
Yes. Each condition typically has its own waiting period. If you have diabetes (12 months) and asthma (6 months), asthma is covered after 6 months, but diabetes coverage starts at month 12.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if my condition is diagnosed after enrollment but during the waiting period?</summary>
It's not pre-existing because it wasn't diagnosed before enrollment. Coverage applies normally after waiting period. This is why timing and being upfront with health status matters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I switch plans to get a shorter waiting period for my condition?</summary>
Sometimes. Different plans have different waiting periods for the same condition. But switching plans also starts a new waiting period. Usually you're stuck with the plan's exclusion.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if health sharing denies claims because of pre-existing conditions?</summary>
You can appeal to the plan. If denied after appeal, claims are your responsibility. This is why understanding coverage before enrolling is critical.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do pre-existing conditions affect my monthly contribution amount?</summary>
Health sharing contributions are usually age-based, not health-based. Pre-existing conditions don't raise your premium, but they do limit coverage during waiting periods.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If I'm diagnosed with a new condition after the waiting period, is that covered immediately?</summary>
Yes. Conditions diagnosed after enrollment are not pre-existing. They're covered immediately (minus normal deductibles). Only pre-enrollment diagnoses have waiting periods.
</details>

## Key Takeaways

1. **Pre-existing means any diagnosis before enrollment** – Even controlled conditions
2. **Waiting periods range 6–12 months** – Some plans exclude entirely
3. **You must disclose all conditions** – Not disclosing is fraud and voids coverage
4. **Ask specific questions before enrolling** – Get waiting periods in writing
5. **Insurance is safer for chronic conditions** – ACA must cover pre-existing from day one

If you have pre-existing conditions, you need to weigh health sharing's cost savings against months of out-of-pocket medication and the risk of uninsured emergencies during waiting periods.
