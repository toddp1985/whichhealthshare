Joining a health sharing plan without answering five critical questions first is why most people regret their choice later, because these five questions determine whether a plan will save you money or cost you thousands in unexpected out-of-pocket expenses. The questions are: Do you have a pre-existing condition? Does faith matter? Can you afford the coverage cap? Can you handle waiting periods? And do you need to satisfy an insurance mandate? — as of February 2026.

## The 5 Critical Questions: A Diagnostic Framework

| Question | Answer "Yes" | Answer "No" |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Do I have a pre-existing condition?** | Choose Zion (day 1) or CrowdHealth. Avoid others. | Any plan works financially. |
| **Does faith requirement bother me?** | Choose Zion, Sedera, or CrowdHealth only. | Most plans work (larger member bases). |
| **Can I cover a $250K+ medical bill out of pocket?** | Choose CrowdHealth (no cap) or keep backup insurance. | Any plan's cap is acceptable. |
| **Can I afford 100% out-of-pocket costs for 6–12 months?** | Choose Zion (immediate) or skip health sharing. | Most plans' waiting periods are OK. |
| **Do I need to satisfy an insurance mandate?** | Skip health sharing entirely; get insurance. | Health sharing is an option. |

## Question 1: Do I Have a Pre-Existing Condition?

This is the single most important question.

If you answer **yes**, you have two realistic paths:

**Path A: Zion HealthShare ($185–$268/month)**  
Covers pre-existing conditions day 1. No waiting period. No phased coverage. Your diabetes, hypertension, or chronic condition is eligible immediately.

Real cost: $185–$268/month + eligible medication costs (shared by plan).

**Path B: CrowdHealth ($140/month + 30–43% advisory fees)**  
Has a 1-year phased waiting period, but the crowdfunding model means your case gets shared if members contribute. Easier to get partial coverage faster than traditional health sharing's hard stops.

Real cost: $140/month + 30–43% of any claims + out-of-pocket during the wait.

**Path C: Any other plan (Medi-Share, CHM, Samaritan)**  
6–12 month waiting period where you pay 100% out of pocket. Real year-one cost is advertised monthly fee + full medical costs during the wait.

Example: You have Type 2 diabetes. You join Medi-Share at $335/month. For 12 months, you pay $335 + 100% of your diabetes medications ($300+/month) = $635/month real cost. That's $7,620 year-one expense, not $4,020.

If you answer **no** to pre-existing conditions, all plans work equally from a financial perspective. You pay monthly contributions and the plan shares eligible costs. The choice then shifts to faith requirements, cost, and community fit.

## Question 2: Does Faith Matter to Me?

If faith is important to you, or if requiring a faith commitment feels invasive, this question determines which plans are even available.

**Plans that REQUIRE faith:**
- Medi-Share (Christian)
- CHM (Christian, strict)
- Samaritan Ministries (Christian)
- Catholic United (Catholic)
- Liberty HealthShare (Christian, strict lifestyle)

**Plans with NO faith requirement:**
- Zion HealthShare (as of Jan 2026, faith is optional)
- Sedera (explicitly secular)
- CrowdHealth (secular)
- OneShare Health (secular)
- HSA Secure (secular)

If you're not Christian or if faith-based organizations feel wrong for your healthcare, the second list is your entire universe. You have 5 options instead of 12.

This isn't a hidden requirement—every plan clearly states it. But many people don't realize until they join that they're submitting to lifestyle guidelines tied to Christian theology. If that matters to you (and it should if you value autonomy), eliminate plans 1–5 immediately.

The trade: Non-religious plans tend to be newer (Sedera, OneShare, CrowdHealth) with smaller member bases, less historical data, and fewer established processes. Medi-Share and CHM have proven 10+ year track records precisely because they're faith-based institutions with longevity.

## Question 3: Can You Realistically Cover a $250K+ Bill Out of Pocket?

Every health sharing plan has a coverage cap per incident:

- Zion: $250,000
- Medi-Share: $350,000
- CHM: $200,000
- Samaritan: $250,000
- CrowdHealth: No cap (unlimited)

If you get cancer and treatment costs $500,000, here's what happens:

**With Zion ($250K cap):** Plan covers $250,000. You pay $250,000.

**With Medi-Share ($350K cap):** Plan covers $350,000. You pay $150,000.

**With CrowdHealth (no cap):** Entire $500,000 gets shared if members contribute (which usually happens).

For healthy people under 50, this feels theoretical—cancer is statistically unlikely. For someone with a serious diagnosis, it's the central question.

If you can't realistically cover a $250K+ out-of-pocket liability, you have three options:

1. **Choose CrowdHealth** (no caps)
2. **Keep a backup insurance policy** (defeats health sharing's cost savings)
3. **Don't join health sharing at all**—stick with insurance

This is the honest trade of health sharing: lower monthly costs in exchange for catastrophic risk above the cap.

**Worried about coverage caps?** [CrowdHealth has no per-incident caps](/reviews/crowdhealth) and no aggregate limits. The trade is the crowdfunding model (contributions are voluntary, not guaranteed). Read how it actually works.

## Question 4: Can You Afford to Pay 100% Out of Pocket for 6–12 Months?

If you have a pre-existing condition and join any plan except Zion, you face a waiting period.

Here's what that costs:

**Scenario: You have high blood pressure. You join Medi-Share in March with a 12-month waiting period.**

- March–February (year 2): You pay 100% of doctor visits, blood pressure medications, and any treatment
- February (12 months in): Waiting period ends. Medi-Share now shares eligible costs.

**Real cost during waiting period:**
- Blood pressure medication: ~$20–50/month
- Doctor visits: ~$150–300 per visit (2–3x/year)
- Lab work: ~$200–400/year
- **Year-one total: $1,800–$3,600 out of pocket**

Plus, you're paying Medi-Share's monthly contribution ($227–$405) during the wait.

**Real year-one cost: $1,800–$3,600 medical + $2,724–$4,860 contributions = $4,524–$8,460**

Compare to insurance (ACA Bronze plan at $350/month):
- **Year-one cost: $4,200** (no waiting periods, covers day 1)

If you don't have $1,800–$3,600 in liquid savings to cover the waiting period costs, health sharing isn't financially viable. You'll run out of money mid-year and face debt.

The answer to "Can you afford 6–12 month waiting periods?" determines plan viability. If no, choose Zion (immediate) or insurance.

## Question 5: Do I Need to Satisfy an Insurance Mandate?

Health sharing does NOT satisfy:

- **ACA employer mandate** (employer must offer insurance or pay penalties)
- **ACA individual mandate** (most states no longer fine uninsured people, but some still do)
- **State insurance requirements** (some states legally require health insurance)
- **Loan requirements** (mortgage lenders sometimes require health insurance proof)

If your employer requires you to have health insurance (and will fine you or deny benefits if you don't), health sharing won't work.

If your state has an individual mandate with penalties (Hawaii, Massachusetts, and a few others still do), health sharing won't satisfy it.

If you're taking out a large mortgage or medical loan, lenders may require insurance proof.

In these cases, you legally need insurance, not health sharing. This isn't optional.

The catch: Many people don't realize their employer's "health insurance requirement" actually means "proof of coverage from an approved insurer"—health sharing doesn't count.

**Check before joining:** Ask your employer's HR whether health sharing satisfies their mandate. The answer is usually no.

## The Bottom Line: A Simple Decision Tree

```
Do you have a pre-existing condition?
  → Yes: Choose Zion (day 1) or CrowdHealth. Skip others.
  → No: Continue to next question.

Does faith matter to you?
  → Yes, I want faith-based: Choose Medi-Share or CHM (largest, cheapest).
  → No, I want secular: Choose Zion, Sedera, or CrowdHealth.

Can you cover a $250K+ medical bill out of pocket?
  → Yes: Continue to next question (any plan works if you have funds).
  → No: Choose CrowdHealth (no cap) or skip health sharing.

Can you afford 100% costs for 6–12 months if needed?
  → Yes: Any plan works (as long as pre-existing doesn't apply).
  → No: Choose Zion (immediate coverage).

Do you need to satisfy an insurance mandate?
  → Yes: Skip health sharing. Get insurance.
  → No: Join the plan that matches your answers above.
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>What's the most important question to ask before joining health sharing?</summary>

The most important question is: Do I have a pre-existing condition? This single factor determines whether health sharing makes financial sense. If yes, you need a plan with no waiting period (Zion) or very fast phased coverage (CrowdHealth). Most plans add $1,800–$3,600 to year-one costs with pre-existing waits.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Should faith requirements matter in my health sharing choice?</summary>

Only if faith is important to you or if faith restrictions bother you. Most health sharing plans (Medi-Share, CHM, Samaritan) require Christian faith commitment. Three major plans don't: Zion (dropped requirement in Jan 2026), Sedera, CrowdHealth. If faith is a dealbreaker, these are your only options.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I have a medical bill above the plan's coverage cap?</summary>

You pay the difference 100%. Zion caps at $250K per incident. Medi-Share at $350K. CHM at $200K. If you have catastrophic risk (cancer, major accident, chronic serious illness), health sharing's caps are a problem. Either choose a plan with a high cap, use CrowdHealth (no cap), or keep insurance as backup.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I realistically afford to wait 6–12 months before coverage kicks in?</summary>

If you have a pre-existing condition and join most plans, you pay 100% out of pocket for 6–12 months. That's $1,800–$3,600+ depending on your medical needs. If you can't absorb that cost, join Zion (day 1 coverage) or reconsider insurance.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need health sharing to satisfy an insurance mandate?</summary>

No. Health sharing (including CrowdHealth) does not satisfy ACA employer mandates, IRS individual mandate penalties, or state insurance requirements. If you need to satisfy a mandate (employer-sponsored coverage, IRS proof of coverage), you need actual insurance, not health sharing.
