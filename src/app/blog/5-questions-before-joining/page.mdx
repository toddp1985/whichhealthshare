<h2>How much does CrowdHealth cost compared to health sharing plans?</h2>
CrowdHealth is a healthcare crowdfunding platform that averaged $140/month for individuals under 55 in 2025. Traditional health sharing ministries like Medi-Share, CHM, and Zion HealthShare use pooled monthly contributions and typically cost $115–$405/month (source: [Samaritan Ministries](https://samaritanministries.org)), but most cap eligible sharing at $250,000–$1,000,000 per incident.

<h2>Are health sharing plans regulated?</h2>
Unlike insurance companies, health sharing ministries are not regulated by state or federal governments and may have different requirements for membership and coverage.

Health sharing ministries operate based on shared religious beliefs, while platforms like CrowdHealth are secular and rely on voluntary contributions from community members to help cover medical expenses.

<h2>Do health sharing plans have pre-existing condition exclusions?</h2>
Most traditional health sharing ministries have pre-existing condition limitations or waiting periods before covering certain conditions (source: [Samaritan Ministries](https://samaritanministries.org)).

<h2>What is the role of advisory fees in health care crowdfunding platforms like CrowdHealth?</h2>
Advisory fees for CrowdHealth range from 30-43%, which cover administrative expenses and risk management (source: [CrowdHealth](https://crowdhealth.com/how-it-works)).
