CrowdHealth is a healthcare crowdfunding platform that averaged $140/month for individuals under 55 in 2025 and has no per-event coverage caps, while traditional health sharing ministries like Medi-Share, CHM, and Zion HealthShare use pooled monthly contributions and typically cost $115–$405/month, but most cap eligible sharing at $250,000–$1,000,000 per incident. The choice between them hinges on whether you prioritize unlimited coverage (CrowdHealth) or predictable monthly costs (health sharing), and how much faith-based community matters to your decision.

## CrowdHealth vs Health Sharing at a Glance

|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Model** | Crowdfunding (event-triggered) | Monthly pooled contributions |
| **Avg. Cost (under 55)** | $140/mo + 30–43% advisory fees | $115–$405/mo, flat |
| **Coverage Caps** | None | $250K–$1M typical |
| **Pre-existing Wait** | 1 year (phased: $25K→$50K→$100K) | 6–12 months (instant at Zion) |
| **Faith Requirement** | None | Most require faith commitment |
| **Tobacco Users** | Accepted (higher contrib.) | Often excluded entirely |

## What Is CrowdHealth, Really?

CrowdHealth isn't insurance and isn't a traditional health sharing ministry. It's a crowdfunding platform where members contribute to a shared account when someone experiences a medical event. Here's how it works in practice:

When you join CrowdHealth, you pay a monthly "advocate fee" (the operational cost, roughly $25–$35). When you need medical care, you submit the bill. Other members then choose whether to contribute to your case. Most cases hit 100% funding, but there's no guarantee—if contributions fall short, you're responsible for the remaining balance.

The trade-off: You get unlimited coverage (no caps) and no faith requirement, but you also accept that contributions are voluntary, not guaranteed. You're betting on community generosity, not pooled mutual obligation.

## What Are Health Sharing Plans, and How Do They Work?

Health sharing ministries operate on the opposite principle: guaranteed monthly pooling. You pay a fixed monthly contribution (typically $115–$405), and that goes into a shared pool with other members. When someone has a medical event, eligible costs are drawn from the pool.

The appeal is predictability. You know your monthly cost upfront. Most plans have transparent guidelines about what they'll cover and what they won't (usually things like cosmetic procedures, pre-existing conditions during wait periods, and fertility treatment).

The catch: Most plans cap eligible sharing at $250,000–$1,000,000 per event. If you have a major medical event that exceeds the cap, you're on your own for the remainder. Additionally, many require a faith statement or active church participation.

## How Much Does Each Option Really Cost?

**CrowdHealth's true cost is harder to calculate.** The advertised monthly fee (~$35–$40) looks cheap, but you also pay 30–43% of any claim amount as an advisory fee. For someone who files a $5,000 claim, that's $1,500–$2,150 going to CrowdHealth's operations. For a $50,000 claim, it's $15,000–$21,500.

Over a year without major claims, CrowdHealth is cheap ($140/month × 12 = $1,680). But if you file even one substantial claim, the advisory fee compounds your total cost.

**Health sharing has flat monthly costs.** Zion HealthShare costs $185–$268/month (no faith required). Medi-Share runs $227–$405/month (Christian). CHM is the cheapest at $115–$264/month (strict Christian, no birth control). You pay that amount every month, regardless of claims.

For someone averaging 2–3 moderate claims per year, health sharing's flat monthly cost often wins. For someone with zero claims, CrowdHealth wins.

## Coverage Limits: The Most Important Difference

This is where the choice gets serious.

**CrowdHealth has no per-incident caps.** If you have a $2 million cancer treatment, there's no coverage ceiling. You're limited only by whether other members fund your request.

**Health sharing ministries cap eligibility per incident.** Zion caps it at $250,000. Medi-Share at $350,000. CHM at $200,000. If your medical event exceeds the cap, you're liable for the difference.

For healthy people or those with normal medical expenses, this difference feels abstract. For someone with a chronic condition, cancer diagnosis, or catastrophic illness, it's the central decision factor.

## Pre-Existing Conditions: Who Covers You from Day One?

This matters immediately if you have an existing health issue.

**CrowdHealth:** 1-year waiting period, then phased coverage ($25K year 2, $50K year 3, $100K year 4+).

**Zion HealthShare:** No waiting period—covers pre-existing conditions in month 1.

**Medi-Share:** 12-month waiting period, then 25%→50%→75%→100% phased over months 13–16.

**CHM:** 6-month waiting period, then 50% coverage for 6 months, then 100%.

**Sedera:** 6-month waiting period, then immediate 100%.

If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or any pre-existing condition, Zion is the only option that covers day 1. Everyone else has a waiting period. (This is a major advantage Zion doesn't advertise enough—it's one of the highest-value differentiators in the market.)

<CalloutBox type="presidio">
**Pre-existing condition concern?** If waiting periods worry you, consider [Presidio Healthcare](/reviews/presidio-healthcare)—it's insurance, not health sharing, and covers pre-existing conditions day 1 for families at $250–$450/month.
</CalloutBox>

## Voluntary vs. Guaranteed: The Philosophy Difference

Here's the philosophical divide that separates CrowdHealth from health sharing:

**CrowdHealth is voluntary.** When you have a claim, other members choose to contribute. Most do. Some don't. If contributions don't fully fund your claim, you're responsible for the gap.

**Health sharing is guaranteed.** You pay monthly. When you have an eligible claim (within guidelines), the ministry shares the cost. It's contractual obligation, not charity.

For people comfortable with interdependence and community trust, CrowdHealth works. For people who need certainty, health sharing works better.

## Faith, Restrictions, and Exclusions

Most health sharing ministries require faith commitment. Zion doesn't (it's secular-friendly). Sedera is explicitly secular. Others require active church participation or Christian affiliation.

CrowdHealth has no faith requirement. It also has no tobacco exclusion—though tobacco users pay higher monthly contributions (roughly 50% more). Most health sharing plans exclude tobacco users entirely.

Medi-Share, CHM, and Samaritan all require faith statements. If you're not faith-driven or if faith-based restrictions feel invasive, CrowdHealth or secular plans (Zion, Sedera) are better fits.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose CrowdHealth if:** You want unlimited coverage, don't have a faith requirement, and can accept that contributions are voluntary (not guaranteed). It works well for healthy individuals and families without major medical events.

**Choose health sharing if:** You want predictable monthly costs, prefer mutual obligation over voluntary crowdfunding, and are comfortable with coverage caps ($250K–$1M). It works better for people who file regular claims and want certainty.

**Choose neither if:** You have a serious pre-existing condition (except Zion), you need insurance-level regulation, or you need to satisfy an employer mandate.

**Methodology:** This comparison reflects 2026 pricing and coverage data from official plan websites, member forums, and analysis of CrowdHealth's funding data (averaged for individuals under 55, 2025).
