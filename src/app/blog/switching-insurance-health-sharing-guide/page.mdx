For canceling ACA/employer insurance: Contact your current plan, confirm cancellation date, verify you received confirmation (critical—don't assume it's cancelled).

Switching from traditional insurance to health sharing can save thousands annually, but it requires careful planning. A single misstep—like a coverage gap, unplanned waiting period, or miscalculated timing—can cost you tens of thousands in medical bills.

This guide walks through the entire switching process step-by-step, with timing strategies to avoid gaps and avoid common mistakes.

## Step 1: Decide if Switching Makes Sense (2-4 weeks before)

Before switching, answer these questions honestly:

**Cost question:** Will health sharing actually save you money?
- Calculate your current insurance costs (premiums + deductibles + expected copays)
- Add up health sharing costs (contributions + waiting period costs + coverage gaps)
- Project 3 years: Does health sharing beat insurance even accounting for waiting periods?

**Health question:** Are you and your family healthy?
- Health sharing works for young, healthy people
- If anyone has serious pre-existing conditions, consider staying on insurance

**Risk question:** Can you absorb coverage gaps?
- If health sharing hits a coverage cap or denies a claim, can you pay $5,000-$50,000 out-of-pocket?
- If no, insurance's guaranteed coverage is safer

**Example calculation:**

| Scenario | ACA Insurance (Year 1) | Health Sharing (Year 1) | Winner |
|----------|---|---|---|
| Healthy family of 4 | $18,000 premium + $7,000 deductible = $25,000 | $6,500 contribution + $0 (healthy) = $6,500 | Health sharing wins ($18,500 savings) |
| Family with 1 pre-existing condition | $18,000 premium + $7,000 deductible = $25,000 | $6,500 contribution + $2,000 waiting period costs = $8,500 | Health sharing wins ($16,500 savings) |
| Solo person with chronic illness | $8,000 premium + $5,000 deductible = $13,000 | $3,500 contribution + $3,000 waiting period costs = $6,500 | Health sharing wins ($6,500 savings) |
| Person needing surgery soon | $8,000 premium + $5,000 deductible = $13,000 | $3,500 contribution + $15,000 surgery out-of-pocket (waiting period) = $18,500 | ACA insurance wins |

---

## Step 2: Choose the Right Health Sharing Plan (3-4 weeks before)

Not all health sharing plans are equal. Compare based on:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Decision Factor</th>
      <th>Best Plan</th>
      <th>Why</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>You have pre-existing conditions</strong></td>
      <td>CrowdHealth</td>
      <td>NO waiting periods; immediate coverage for all conditions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>You want HSA coordination for tax savings</strong></td>
      <td>Zion or Christian Healthcare Ministries</td>
      <td>HDHP-compatible; allows HSA contributions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>You want lowest cost</strong></td>
      <td>Medi-Share</td>
      <td>Lowest monthly contributions; kids especially cheap</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>You want predictable rates</strong></td>
      <td>Zion HealthShare</td>
      <td>Fixed rates by age; no surprise assessments</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>You're self-employed (Schedule C)</strong></td>
      <td>Zion + HSA Secure</td>
      <td>Tax-deductible, HSA-eligible for max tax savings</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>You're faith-based</strong></td>
      <td>Christian Healthcare Ministries</td>
      <td>Aligns with church community; good coverage</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Step 3: Verify Coverage for Your Medications/Conditions (3 weeks before)

**This step is critical and often skipped.**

Get a detailed list of:
1. **Current medications** (names, dosages, frequency)
2. **Current diagnoses** (conditions you've been diagnosed with in past 5 years)
3. **Recent procedures** (surgeries, hospitalizations in past 2 years)

Call your chosen health sharing plan. Ask:

*"I'm considering enrolling. I want to verify coverage for these specific items:*
- *Medication: Lisinopril 10mg daily - Is this covered? Any waiting period?"*
- *Condition: Hypertension, diagnosed 3 years ago - What's your waiting period?"*
- *Recent procedure: Knee surgery 18 months ago - Is post-op care covered?"*

**Get written confirmation** (email is fine). Do not rely on phone conversations—plans change, reps make mistakes.

---

## Step 4: Calculate Coverage Gaps and Waiting Periods (2 weeks before)

List out all expected out-of-pocket costs during year 1:

| Cost Category | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Waiting period medications (pre-existing) | $2,000 | 12 months of pre-diabetes meds, not covered |
| Waiting period doctor visits (pre-existing) | $600 | Quarterly check-ups, not covered |
| Non-covered medications | $400 | Plan doesn't cover this allergy medication |
| Coverage gap out-of-pocket max | $0 | (if any) |
| **Total estimated year 1 out-of-pocket** | **$3,000** | |

This helps you budget and prepare for surprises.

---

## Step 5: Give Current Insurance 30-60 Days Notice (2 weeks before)

Contact your current insurer (ACA marketplace or employer) and ask:

**"I want to cancel coverage effective [DATE]. What's the process and what documentation do you need?"**

Key points:
- Most insurers require 30 days' notice (cancellation effective 30 days after request)
- Some allow immediate cancellation
- You'll get confirmation email—save it for your records
- **Do NOT assume you're cancelled until you get written confirmation**

Example timeline:
- Feb 1: Call ACA marketplace, request cancellation effective March 1
- Feb 1: Enroll in health sharing, effective March 1
- March 1: Both cancel and new plan start same day (no gap, no overlap)

---

## Step 6: Enroll in Health Sharing (1-2 weeks before target switch date)

**Online enrollment (fastest):**
1. Go to plan's website (e.g., zionhealthshare.com)
2. Click "Enroll" or "Apply"
3. Fill out application (takes 15-30 minutes)
4. Provide medical history (5-10 year lookback)
5. Review and sign agreement
6. Choose effective date (most plans allow dates 1-30 days in future)
7. Set up payment method (bank account for automatic withdrawal)

**Phone enrollment (if you have questions):**
1. Call plan's enrollment line
2. Speak with agent (takes 30-60 minutes)
3. Agent enters your information
4. You receive confirmation email

**After enrollment:**
- You'll receive confirmation email with effective date, member ID, and payment details
- Verify the effective date matches your insurance cancellation date
- Save confirmation email and member ID for records

---

## Step 7: Set Up Payment and Pharmacy Access (1 week before)

**Automatic payment setup:**
- Log into your health sharing plan account (or call)
- Add bank account for monthly auto-withdrawal
- Confirm payment date (usually 1st of month)
- Test with first payment or wait for it to draft

**Pharmacy access:**
- Some plans email pharmacy discount cards or network info
- Download the app (if plan has one)
- Save customer service number
- Understand: How to get prescriptions covered, how to submit claims for medications

**Primary care setup (optional but recommended):**
- Choose a primary care doctor if plan uses that model
- Or identify a doctor you'll use for routine care
- Verify they're in-network or allow direct billing

---

## Step 8: Cancel Your Old Insurance (Effective Date)

**Confirm cancellation:**
1. Call your current insurer (ACA: healthcare.gov or state marketplace; Employer: HR/benefits)
2. Provide your policy number
3. Request cancellation effective [date]
4. Ask for confirmation email
5. Ask: "If I have bills from this month, how do I submit them?"

**Do NOT cancel early:**
- If you want coverage through Feb 28, cancel effective March 1 (not Feb 15)
- If you cancel too early, claims submitted after cancellation won't be covered
- Check if your plan allows claims submission after cancellation (typically 30-90 days post-cancellation)

---

## Step 9: Manage Overlapping Coverage (If You Overlap)

If you overlap coverage (keep ACA through Feb 28, start health sharing March 1):

**During overlap period:**
- Decide which plan to use for healthcare visits
- Typically: Use old insurance for any major care (surgery, urgent issues)
- Let health sharing sit unused (avoiding claims avoids complications)
- Update doctors' offices: "Effective March 1, use this new health sharing info"

**After overlap ends:**
- Use health sharing plan for all healthcare
- Shred old insurance cards (so you don't accidentally use them)
- Update doctors' offices with new health sharing info

---

## Step 10: Transition Healthcare Providers (If Needed)

**If switching from employer/ACA with established doctors:**

1. **Call current doctors** (1 week before switch)
   - "I'm switching insurance/health sharing effective [date]. Here's my new member ID and plan."
   - Ask: "Do you accept [health sharing plan]?"
   - If yes: Update in their system
   - If no: Ask for referral to a doctor who does accept it

2. **Update prescriptions:**
   - Ask current doctor to send new prescriptions to pharmacy (if pharmacy changes)
   - Or ask doctor to provide paper prescriptions for you to submit

3. **Request medical records:**
   - Ask for copy of recent records to share with new doctor (if switching)
   - Or confirm new doctor can access via electronic health records

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Cancelling old insurance before health sharing is confirmed**
- Don't cancel ACA until you receive confirmation email from health sharing with effective date
- Risk: Coverage gap where you're uninsured
- Solution: Wait for health sharing confirmation, verify dates match, then cancel

**Mistake 2: Not accounting for waiting period costs**
- People switch to health sharing expecting instant savings
- Waiting period for pre-existing condition costs $1,000-$4,000 year 1
- Solution: Budget for waiting period costs in advance

**Mistake 3: Choosing wrong plan for your conditions**
- Switching to a plan with waiting periods when you have pre-existing conditions
- Solution: Use CrowdHealth (no waiting periods) if you have pre-existing conditions

**Mistake 4: Not verifying medication coverage before switching**
- Switching to health sharing, then discovering key medications aren't covered
- Solution: Call plan, verify medication coverage in writing, before enrolling

**Mistake 5: Switching mid-year without understanding tax credits**
- Switching from ACA subsidized plan mid-year, then owing back credits at tax time
- Solution: Notify marketplace when switching, reconcile expected subsidy value

**Mistake 6: Expecting coverage gaps to be "fixed" immediately**
- Once you join health sharing with a coverage gap, you can't retroactively get it covered
- Solution: Don't rely on health sharing until you understand what it won't cover

## Timeline Template: 8-Week Switching Plan

**Week 1:** Decide if switching makes sense (cost + health analysis)
**Week 2:** Choose health sharing plan, call to verify coverage
**Week 3:** Verify medications and conditions coverage (in writing)
**Week 4:** Give old insurance cancellation notice (30 days ahead)
**Week 5:** Enroll in health sharing online
**Week 6:** Set up automatic payment, pharmacy access, verify effective date
**Week 7:** Update healthcare providers, request medical records
**Week 8 (Effective date):** Old insurance cancels, health sharing activates

---

## Special Cases: Switching Timing

**Switching from ACA:**
- Best timing: January 1 (reset deductibles, waiting periods start on calendar year)
- Wait if: You haven't met deductible yet (finish using ACA first)
- Bad timing: December (right before deductible resets on ACA plan)

**Switching from employer health insurance:**
- Best timing: When leaving job (COBRA coverage ends, switch to health sharing)
- Wait if: You're in middle of expensive medical event (finish treatment on employer plan)
- Bad timing: Right before health insurance benefit year resets (employers usually Jan 1)

**Switching from Medicare:**
- You can't switch to health sharing (health sharing doesn't cover people 65+)
- Medicare is your only option for seniors

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>What happens to my health information when I switch?</summary>

Your health information stays with your old insurance (they keep your medical records). Your new health sharing plan will ask for a medical history summary (5-10 year lookback) during enrollment. You don't need to transfer old records unless you want them at a new doctor. Health sharing won't have access to your previous insurance claims (by law, HIPAA separates providers).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I switch back to ACA insurance if health sharing doesn't work out?</summary>

Yes, but timing matters. You can switch back to ACA during annual open enrollment (Nov 1 - Dec 15) without a qualifying life event. If you have a qualifying event (birth, marriage, job loss, health insurance loss), you can switch mid-year. Health sharing loss alone is NOT a qualifying event—you need a separate life event to justify mid-year ACA enrollment.

</details>

<details>
<summary>If I have a pending claim with my old insurance, will it be paid?</summary>

Usually yes, but confirm before cancelling. Contact your old insurer: "I have pending claims. If I cancel on March 1, will you still process and pay claims submitted before then?" Most insurers process claims for 30-90 days after cancellation. Save all receipts and claim documentation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to notify my employer if I switch from employer health insurance to health sharing?</summary>

No. Your employer only cares that you drop coverage. They won't be involved in your health sharing enrollment. However, if your employer has HSA benefits, confirm your HSA account status—it might close when you drop employer coverage. If switching to HDHP + HSA strategy, set up individual HSA before dropping employer coverage.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I switch to health sharing mid-year, then get diagnosed with a new condition in month 6?</summary>

Good news: New diagnoses after enrollment are covered immediately (no waiting period). Only pre-existing conditions (diagnosed before enrollment) have waiting periods. A diagnosis made 3 months into health sharing is a new condition = full coverage.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I switch health sharing plans mid-year?</summary>

Yes. Most health sharing plans allow month-to-month cancellation. If you enroll in Zion and don't like it, you can switch to Medi-Share anytime. However: (1) You restart waiting periods with the new plan; (2) You might lose accumulated benefits; (3) There may be overlapping costs if you don't time cancellations correctly. Switching mid-year is possible but not ideal.
