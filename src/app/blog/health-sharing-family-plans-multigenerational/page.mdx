Families are health sharing's sweet spot. A family of four pays $500–$800/month vs. $1,200–$2,000 for insurance, making the economics compelling. But family structures vary—what if grandparents live with you? What about adult children? What about pregnancy?

Here's how to navigate health sharing for families of all configurations.

## The Family vs. Individual Math

**Scenario: Family of 4 (Parents 40 & 38, Kids 10 & 7)**

**Individual plans (4 separate memberships):**
- Parent 1 (40): $280/month
- Parent 2 (38): $260/month
- Child 1 (10): $100/month
- Child 2 (7): $100/month
- **Total: $740/month = $8,880/year**

**Family plan (1 membership covering all 4):**
- Family of 4: $580/month
- **Total: $580/month = $6,960/year**

**Savings with family plan: $1,920/year (21% cheaper)**

Most health sharing plans offer family rates that bundle 2 adults + all dependent children for less than 4 individual plans.

## Family Plan Structure & Limits

### Per-Person vs. Per-Family Sharing Amounts

**Per-Person Sharing (Some plans like CrowdHealth):**
- Each family member has individual monthly sharing limit
- Example: $1,000/month sharing per person = $4,000/month for family of 4
- If one child needs $3,000 surgery, only that child's limit is used
- Other family members' limits untouched
- **Advantage:** Limits are high because distributed across family

**Per-Family Sharing (Some plans like Medi-Share):**
- Family has one total sharing limit
- Example: Family limit = $5,000/month (total for all 4 members)
- If parent needs $3,000 emergency, family limit drops to $2,000 remaining
- Other family needs compete for remaining funds
- **Disadvantage:** Limits are shared; large claims by one member reduce coverage for others

## Real-World Family Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Sarah & Mike, Ages 38 & 40, Kids 8 & 5 (Healthy Family)**

- Current insurance: ACA family Silver, $1,400/month = $16,800/year
- Health sharing option: Aliera family plan, $620/month = $7,440/year
- Savings: $9,360/year
- Assumptions: No major claims, kids are healthy
- Risk: Any child with emergency + surgery during waiting period = out-of-pocket
- Decision: Switch to health sharing; family is low-risk

**Year 1 Actual Costs:**
- Premiums: $7,440
- Daughter's ear infections (3 visits): $600 out-of-pocket (covered after waiting period)
- Son's asthma inhalers: $300 (covered)
- Annual checkups: $0 (preventative)
- **Total: $7,440 + $900 = $8,340**

**Comparison to insurance:** Insurance would have charged $16,800; family saved $8,460

**Scenario 2: Jennifer & David, Ages 45 & 48, Kids 16, 14, 12, Parent (Mom, 72)**

- Current: ACA family + Mom on Medicare + Medigap
  - Family (4): $1,680/month
  - Mom Medicare: $170/month (Part B) + $250/month Medigap
  - **Total: $2,100/month = $25,200/year**

- Health sharing option for family:
  - Family plan (4): $780/month
  - Mom: Individual health sharing ($420/month, age 72—hard to find)
  - **Total: $1,200/month = $14,400/year**

**Savings: $10,800/year**

- Catch: Mom age 72 is ineligible for most health sharing (caps at 65)
- Reality: Mom must stay on Medicare + Medigap; family can try health sharing
- Revised cost: Family $9,360 + Mom $3,000 (Medicare) = $12,360/year
- **Net savings vs. all insured: ~$12,840/year**

**Scenario 3: Rachel & John, Ages 34 & 36, Kids 9 & 6, Rachel Pregnant**

- Current insurance: $1,200/month
- Health sharing option: Need to enroll while Rachel is pregnant
- Problem: Pregnancy is often a pre-existing condition
- Plan A (CrowdHealth): Covers pregnancy at enrollment (6-month wait for maternity)
  - Cost: $680/month
  - Maternity coverage: Possible after 6-month waiting period (risky if due date is within 6 months)
  - Decision: Risky; stay on insurance if due date is within 6 months

- Plan B (Aliera): Pregnancy treatment excluded completely
  - Cost: $640/month (cheaper)
  - Maternity coverage: $0 during pregnancy
  - Decision: Can't use Aliera while pregnant; must use ACA or insurance

**Scenario 4: Marcus & Lisa, Ages 52 & 50, Adult Child (28), Kids 11 & 8**

- Current: ACA family (3 kids) + adult child individual
  - Family (3 kids): $1,100/month
  - Adult child (28): $280/month
  - **Total: $1,380/month = $16,560/year**

- Health sharing option:
  - Family plan (2 parents + 2 minor kids): $780/month
  - Adult child (28) individual: $200/month
  - **Total: $980/month = $11,760/year**

**Savings: $4,800/year**

- Trade-off: Adult child is no longer covered under family; cost for adult separate
- Better scenario: If adult child moves out, family savings are clear
- If adult child stays in household, some plans allow "dependent" coverage; verify

**Scenario 5: The Extended Multigenerational Household (4 Generations)**

- Grandparents (75 & 73) – Medicare eligible, ineligible for health sharing
- Parents (48 & 46) – Can use health sharing
- Grandkids (14, 11, 8) – Included in family plan
- Challenge: Grandparents need their own Medicare + Medigap (can't use family plan)

**Cost breakdown:**
- Parents + kids (5 people): Family plan $650/month = $7,800/year
- Grandparents: Medicare $170 × 2 + Medigap $250 × 2 = $840/month = $10,080/year
- **Total multigenerational household: $17,880/year**

**vs. All on insurance:**
- If grandparents, parents, kids were all on family ACA insurance
- Extended family plan: $2,200/month = $26,400/year

**Savings: $8,520/year by splitting (health sharing for young, Medicare for elderly)**

## Common Family Myths About Health Sharing

**Myth 1: The entire family gets one waiting period**
False. Each family member's waiting period is independent. Parent 1 waits 30 days; Parent 2 waits 30 days; kids wait 30 days—each on their own timeline starting from their enrollment date.

**Myth 2: If one family member has a pre-existing condition, the whole family waits**
False. Only the member with the pre-existing condition waits. Other family members are covered immediately for non-related conditions.

**Myth 3: Family plans cover everyone regardless of size**
False. Most family plans define "family" as 2 adults + dependent children. Extended family (grandparents, adult children, aunts/uncles) must enroll separately.

**Myth 4: If kids age out (turn 26), they're automatically covered as adults**
False. At age 26, dependent coverage ends. Adult child must enroll as individual member with new waiting period.

**Myth 5: Pregnancy is always covered under family plans**
False. Pregnancy is often treated as pre-existing and excluded for 6–12 months. Enroll before pregnancy if possible.

**Myth 6: Family plans are always cheaper than individual plans**
Usually true for 2+ adults + kids. But if only one adult + kids, individual plans might be cheaper. Always compare.

## Choosing a Family Health Sharing Plan

**Best for large families (4+ members):**
- CrowdHealth (family = 1 membership, lower cost)
- Aliera (family plans with flexible member additions)
- Medi-Share (family plans, well-established)

**Best for families with pre-existing conditions:**
- CrowdHealth (shorter waiting periods, 6 months)
- Aliera (transparent about per-condition waiting periods)

**Best for pregnant families:**
- CrowdHealth (explicitly includes maternity coverage after waiting period)
- Insurance may be safer during pregnancy

**Best for extended families (grandparents living with family):**
- Enroll parents + kids in family health sharing
- Enroll grandparents separately (if eligible) or on Medicare + Medigap
- Split plans between types

## FAQ: Family-Specific Scenarios

<details>
<summary>If we have 5 kids, is there an added cost per child?</summary>
No. Family plans cover all dependent children regardless of number (usually). 5 kids = same family plan cost as 2 kids. Confirm with your plan.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if one parent is 65+?</summary>
Age 65+ parent likely ineligible for health sharing. That parent needs Medicare + Medigap. Younger parent + kids can use family health sharing plan.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can a single parent with kids use a family plan?</summary>
Most plans require 2 adults for "family" plan. Single parent likely pays individual plan for self + kids as dependents OR individual plans for each member. Verify plan rules.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do step-children count toward family plans?</summary>
Only if legally dependent (claimed on taxes, insurance documentation shows dependency). Verify with plan; rules vary.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if we have twins?</summary>
Twins count as 2 dependent children. Some plans have no limit on number of children; others cap at 5–6. Confirm with your plan.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If we have a child with special needs, what's the cost impact?</summary>
Health sharing considers special needs like any other condition. Pre-existing conditions (CP, autism, genetic disorders) typically have 6–12 month waiting periods. Higher costs if severe condition requiring frequent care.
</details>

## Key Takeaways for Families

1. **Family plans save 20–40% vs. individual plans** – A family of 4 saves $2,000–$5,000/year
2. **Waiting periods apply per person, not per family** – Each member has independent 30–60 day coverage delay
3. **Pregnancy is often excluded** – Enroll before pregnancy for coverage
4. **Grandparents (65+) are usually ineligible** – Must use Medicare + Medigap
5. **Pre-existing conditions are per-person** – Other family members covered immediately

For families, health sharing's cost savings are substantial. The key is understanding family plan structure, waiting periods per member, and pre-existing condition handling for each family member.
