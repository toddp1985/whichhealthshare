      <p className="text-lg mb-6">Health sharing plans advertise monthly costs of $140–$350, but the actual cost is much higher when you factor in waiting periods, coverage caps, claim denials, and administrative fees.</p>
      <p className="mb-6">As of February 2026, a member might pay $140/month in contributions but face an additional $5,000–$15,000 in hidden costs annually—meaning the true cost is often 2–4 times the advertised monthly rate.</p>
