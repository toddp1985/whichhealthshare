Health sharing plans' 2026 landscape remained largely stable, with most plans maintaining their structure, though **Medi-Share raised rates 8–12%** and **Zion dropped its faith requirement as of January 2026**, marking the year's most significant policy shift. The 'big five' ministries (Medi-Share, CHM, Zion, Samaritan, CrowdHealth) still dominate, but price increases narrowed the cost advantage over short-term insurance.

## Which Health Sharing Plans Increased Rates?

| Plan | 2026 Change | Faith Required | Pre-existing Wait |
|------|---|---|---|
| **Medi-Share** | +8–12% increase | Yes | 12 months |
| **CHM** | No change | Yes | 6 months |
| **Zion HealthShare** | +6–8% in 2026 | ~~Yes~~ No (dropped) | Immediate |
| **Samaritan** | No change | Yes | 6 months |
| **CrowdHealth** | Flat advocate fee, higher advisory % | No | 1 year (phased) |
| **Sedera** | No change | No | 6 months |

Medi-Share's hike stung most—a family plan jumped from $385 to $415–$445/month. The plan cited medical inflation, higher 2025 claims, and regulatory costs. CHM and Samaritan held the line, keeping their models competitive for budget-conscious families.

## What Happened With Zion's Faith Requirement?

This was 2026's watershed moment. Zion HealthShare (founded 1981) made its faith requirement optional, effective January 2026. You no longer need a faith statement to join. Zion becomes the most accessible major health sharing plan—no faith statement, no tobacco exclusions, no lifestyle restrictions.

**The trade:** Rates went up 6–8% to offset expansion. You're paying more for less restriction. Zion still costs $185–$268/month, competitive with post-increase Medi-Share pricing.

For people exploring health sharing for the first time, Zion is now the starting point. It has the best pre-existing condition coverage (day 1, no waiting) and now the fewest restrictions.

## Are New Health Sharing Plans Launching?

No major new ministries launched in 2026, but HSA Secure expanded significantly. This hybrid option (mixing HSA savings with pooled coverage) grew from 8 pilot states to 28 states. It's designed for self-employed people maximizing HSA savings.

HSA Secure occupies a strange middle ground: not quite health sharing, not quite insurance. For the right person (small business owner with HDHP), it's clever. For most people, traditional health sharing or insurance is simpler.

## What Stayed Exactly the Same?

Three fundamentals didn't budge:

**Coverage caps held steady.** Zion caps at $250K per incident. Medi-Share at $350K. CHM at $200K. Samaritan at $250K. CrowdHealth has no cap. These define the risk you're taking.

**Pre-existing waiting periods remained unchanged.** Most plans still have 6–12 month waits (except Zion at day 1). Waiting periods are written into member agreements and rarely change.

**Regulation stayed absent.** Health sharing remains unregulated by state insurance commissioners and doesn't satisfy ACA employer mandate requirements. That didn't change.

## What Did Plans NOT Announce?

A few conspicuous absences:

**No new coverage expansions.** Plans didn't announce newly covered procedures or conditions, suggesting moderate (not strong) member satisfaction.

**No mergers or consolidation.** The health sharing space remains fragmented. The "big five" are still independent.

**No major tech updates.** CrowdHealth keeps pace with app improvements. Medi-Share, CHM, and Samaritan's member portals feel unchanged from 2024.

## Is Health Sharing Still Worth It?

For healthy people under 50, yes. CHM is still the cheapest at $115–$264/month. But 2026's price increases (Medi-Share +8–12%, Zion +6–8%) narrowed the gap. The value proposition depends on age and health status.

Pre-existing conditions present real friction: 6–12 month waiting periods mean you can't access coverage immediately. If you have chronic conditions, health sharing's model feels limiting.

**Bottom line:** 2026 is a consolidation year, not innovation. Rates trended up. Zion opened doors. The fundamental proposition (low costs, no regulation, coverage caps, waiting periods) didn't shift. Health sharing remains viable for healthy individuals, but cost advantage over insurance narrowed.
