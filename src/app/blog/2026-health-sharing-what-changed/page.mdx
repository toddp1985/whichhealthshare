Health sharing plans' 2026 landscape remained largely stable, with most plans maintaining their 2025 structure and three-year coverage frameworks, though Medi-Share raised rates 8–12%, Zion increased 6–8% for members over 50, and Zion HealthShare dropped its faith requirement entirely as of January 2026. The 'big five' health sharing ministries (Medi-Share, CHM, Zion, Samaritan, CrowdHealth) still dominate the market, but price increases have narrowed their cost advantage over short-term insurance and ACA plans.

## What Changed in Health Sharing Between 2025 and 2026

| Plan | 2025 Rate Status | 2026 Change | Faith Required | Pre-existing Wait |
|------|-----------------|-------------|---|---|
| **Medi-Share** | Stable 2024–2025 | +8–12% increase | Yes | 12 months |
| **CHM** | Flat 2023–2025 | No change | Yes | 6 months |
| **Zion HealthShare** | +5% in 2025 | +6–8% in 2026 | ~~Yes~~ No (dropped) | Immediate |
| **Samaritan Ministries** | Stable | No change | Yes | 6 months |
| **CrowdHealth** | $35–$40 fee | Advocate fee flat, advisory fee 35–43% | No | 1 year (phased) |
| **Sedera** | $180–$280/mo | No change | No | 6 months |
| **HSA Secure** | Pilot program | Expanded to 28 states | No | Varies |

## The Big Shift: Zion HealthShare Dropped Faith Requirement

This was the year's most significant policy change. Zion HealthShare, one of the oldest health sharing ministries (founded 1981), announced in November 2025 that it was making its faith requirement optional. As of January 2026, you no longer need a faith statement to join.

What this means: Zion just became the most accessible major health sharing plan. It already had the best pre-existing condition coverage (day 1, no waiting period). Now it also has no faith requirement, no tobacco exclusions, and no lifestyle restrictions. For people exploring health sharing for the first time, Zion is now the starting point.

The downside: Zion's rates went up 6–8% in 2026 to offset policy expansion. You're paying more for less restriction, which is honest tradeoff design. Still, Zion costs $185–$268/month—competitive with Medi-Share's new post-increase rates.

## Price Increases Hit 2026 Budget Plans

Medi-Share's 2026 increase stung more than expected. A family plan that cost $385/month in late 2025 now costs $415–$445. For individuals, the jump was 8–12% across most age categories.

Why? Medi-Share cited medical inflation, higher-than-expected claims in 2025, and regulatory compliance costs as reasons.

CHM held the line. The cheapest major health sharing option in the US ($115–$264/month for individuals) didn't raise rates. This makes CHM the value play for 2026, though it comes with strict faith requirements and no flexibility on lifestyle restrictions.

Samaritan Ministries also held rates. Zion increased 6–8% but dropped its faith requirement, so the trade is arguably even. CrowdHealth kept advocate fees flat but adjusted advisory fees (the percentage cut on claims) upward.

What this means for you: If you've been sitting on joining health sharing "someday," 2026 is the year to move. Rates are trending up, and they rarely go down.

## New Players and Expansions: HSA Secure Steps Into 2026

HSA Secure, the hybrid "health sharing meets HSA" option, expanded from 8 pilot states to 28 states in 2026. This is significant because HSA Secure occupies a strange middle ground: it's not quite health sharing, not quite insurance, but it solves one specific problem—connecting HSA savings to covered medical expenses without triggering HDHP restrictions.

How HSA Secure works: You fund your HSA, and HSA Secure covers medical expenses above your deductible using a pooled model (similar to health sharing). It's designed for self-employed people and families who maximize HSA savings and want stability below the deductible.

The limitation: It's only available in 28 states (still not nationwide), and it requires an HDHP enrollment. For the right person, it's a clever play. For most people, traditional health sharing or insurance is simpler.

## What Stayed the Same: The Fundamentals

Three things didn't change in 2026, and they matter:

**Coverage caps remained unchanged.** Zion still caps at $250K per incident. Medi-Share at $350K. CHM at $200K. Samaritan at $250K. CrowdHealth has no cap. These limits define the risk you're taking on. No surprises here.

**Pre-existing condition waiting periods held steady.** Most plans still have 6–12 month waits (except Zion at day 1). This is huge for people comparing plans mid-year. Don't expect movement here—waiting periods are written into member agreements and rarely change.

**Faith requirement policy stayed mostly static**, except for Zion. Medi-Share, CHM, and Samaritan still require faith statements. No exceptions announced. Sedera remains explicitly non-religious. CrowdHealth has no faith requirement.

**Regulation remained absent.** Health sharing is still unregulated by state insurance commissioners, still not recognized as insurance, and still doesn't satisfy ACA employer mandate requirements. If you need to satisfy an insurance mandate, health sharing doesn't work. That didn't change in 2026.

## What Wasn't Announced (But Could Matter)

A few changes felt conspicuously absent from 2026 announcements:

**No new coverage expansions.** Most plans didn't announce new procedures or conditions they'd cover. This suggests member satisfaction is moderate—neither breaking nor thriving.

**No major mergers or acquisitions.** The health sharing space remains fragmented. No mega-consolidation, no buyouts. The "big five" are still independent.

**No technology updates from major players.** CrowdHealth keeps pace with app features, but Medi-Share, CHM, and Samaritan's member portals feel unchanged from 2024. Digital experience isn't a differentiator yet.

## The Bottom Line

2026 is a year of consolidation, not innovation. Rates went up for some (Medi-Share, Zion), stayed flat for others (CHM, Samaritan). Zion opened doors by dropping faith requirements. The fundamental proposition—low monthly costs, no insurance regulation, coverage caps, waiting periods—didn't shift. Health sharing remains a viable option for healthy individuals and families under 50, especially if they can tolerate 6–12 month pre-existing condition waits. But the cost advantage over insurance narrowed in 2026, so comparison shopping matters more than ever.
