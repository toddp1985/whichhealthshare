Freelancers paying full health care costs spend an average of $400–$600/month for individual ACA coverage, while health sharing plans range from $150–$280/month with lower administrative overhead. As of Feb 2026, self-employed workers must weigh the monthly savings against waiting periods, coverage limits, and lack of tax deductions that ACA plans provide.

## Your Key Questions Answered

### Can Freelancers Deduct Health Sharing Contributions on Taxes?
Freelancers can deduct health sharing contributions under the self-employed health insurance deduction (Schedule C, Line 14), but only if the organization qualifies as a recognized sharing arrangement. Most health sharing ministries do qualify. The deduction is limited to your self-employment income—you cannot deduct more than you earned. Unlike ACA plans, health sharing deductions are not subsidized by tax credits. Bottom line: you save roughly 15% in self-employment tax on deducted premiums, but no additional federal subsidy applies. ACA Silver plans with subsidies often provide better total savings.
### What If I Get Sick as a Freelancer? Can I Still Afford Care?
This is the critical risk for freelancers using health sharing. If you get a serious illness, health sharing caps your benefits at $125K–$1M annually. A 3-month hospitalization can cost $100K+. If you exceed your coverage limit mid-year, remaining care is your financial responsibility. With ACA plans, your costs cap at your out-of-pocket maximum ($8,000–$10,000 yearly), and coverage is unlimited. As a freelancer with no employer safety net, a catastrophic illness with health sharing could bankrupt you. This is why many financial advisors recommend ACA for freelancers despite higher premiums.
### How Do Waiting Periods Affect Freelancers Starting New Ventures?
If you start a freelance business, enroll in health sharing, and face a medical emergency during the 30–90 day waiting period, you have zero coverage. Many freelancers delay insurance enrollment to 'save money' but this exposes them to high risk. The waiting period means your first 3 months of freelance health costs are out-of-pocket. ACA has no waiting period. If you're starting a business, ACA provides immediate peace of mind, even if the monthly cost is higher. CrowdHealth and similar organizations honor waiting periods strictly—no exceptions for founders.
### Are Self-Employed People at Risk for Health Sharing Insolvency?
Yes. Health sharing organizations sometimes collapse or suspend claim payouts during economic downturns. Unlike insurance companies (which must maintain reserve funds), health sharing relies on a healthy membership to fund claims month-to-month. If membership drops 30% due to recession, organizations may stop accepting new claims or raise rates 50%+. As a freelancer with variable income, you're already exposed to economic risk. Adding health sharing organizational risk on top compounds vulnerability. ACA plans are regulated and state-backed, ensuring claims are paid even if your insurer faces temporary insolvency.
### Should Freelancers Use an HSA with Health Sharing?
No. HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) require a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) certified by the IRS. Most health sharing plans don't qualify for HSA eligibility because they're not regulated insurance. This disqualifies freelancers from one of the best tax-advantaged savings tools. ACA Bronze and some Silver plans qualify as HDHPs, allowing you to pair them with HSA contributions ($3,850 self-only in 2026). The triple tax advantage (deductible contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawal for medical) is worth significant savings over time. Health sharing cannot provide this.
### What's the True Cost Comparison for a Freelancer Over 5 Years?
A healthy freelancer age 35 might pay: Health sharing: $150/month × 60 = $9,000 over 5 years. ACA Silver with subsidy: $250/month × 60 = $15,000 before factoring in the tax subsidy and HSA savings. However, one $50K hospitalization during those 5 years would cost the health sharing member $15K–$25K out-of-pocket (after their benefit cap). The ACA member's cap is $8K. Across 5 years, ACA often costs less when you model real illness probability. For healthy freelancers who truly never get sick, health sharing is cheaper. For those willing to trade monthly cost for certainty, ACA wins.
