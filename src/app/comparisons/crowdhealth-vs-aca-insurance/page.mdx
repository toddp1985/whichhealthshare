CrowdHealth ($140/month + 30–43% advisory fees on claims) and ACA insurance ($350–$800/month depending on subsidies and age) represent the most common comparison for uninsured people: CrowdHealth is cheaper on a monthly basis but includes hidden advisory fee costs, while ACA insurance costs more monthly but provides government-regulated protection and no percentage-based claim fees. The actual winner depends on whether you qualify for ACA subsidies, your expected claim volume, and your risk tolerance.

## The Cost Matrix

| Scenario | CrowdHealth | ACA Bronze (no subsidy) | ACA Silver (with subsidy) | Winner |
|----------|-------------|---|---|---|
| **Zero claims/year** | $1,680 | $5,400 | $2,400 | CrowdHealth |
| **One $2,000 claim** | $1,680 + $600–$860 fees = $2,280–$2,540 | $5,400 | $2,400 | ACA (if subsidies apply) |
| **Multiple claims, $5,000 total** | $1,680 + $1,500–$2,150 = $3,180–$3,830 | $5,400 | $2,400 | ACA (if subsidies apply) |
| **One $50,000 claim** | $1,680 + $15,000–$21,500 = $16,680–$23,180 | $5,400 + $10,000 deductible = $15,400 | $2,400 + $7,000 deductible = $9,400 | ACA wins significantly |

**Key insight:** CrowdHealth wins for zero-claim years. ACA wins for any claim-heavy year, especially with subsidies.

## CrowdHealth: Cheap Until You Claim

CrowdHealth's base cost is undeniably low: $35–$40/month for the "advocate fee" (operational cost).

**The advisory fee surprise:**
When you file a claim, CrowdHealth takes 30–43% of the total contributed amount as an "advisory fee."

Example: $5,000 claim, 35% fee = $1,750 out of pocket for CrowdHealth's operations.

This is transparent in CrowdHealth's documentation, but many people don't factor it into their budget until they file a claim.

**Real annual cost scenarios:**

**Healthy person (zero claims):**
- Monthly: $140
- Year-1 cost: $1,680
- ACA costs twice as much

**Healthy person with one moderate claim ($3,000):**
- Monthly: $140 × 12 = $1,680
- Advisory fee (35%): $1,050
- Year-1 total: $2,730
- ACA would cost: $5,400–$7,400 (depending on subsidies)
- CrowdHealth still wins

**Person with multiple claims ($8,000 total):**
- Monthly: $1,680
- Advisory fees (35–43%): $2,800–$3,440
- Year-1 total: $4,480–$5,120
- ACA with Silver subsidy: $2,400
- ACA wins significantly

## ACA Insurance: More Expensive Monthly, But Predictable

ACA insurance costs more but includes no percentage-based claim fees.

**Without subsidies (self-employed, too much income for subsidy):**
- Bronze plan: $400–$600/month (high deductible, $7,000–$10,000)
- Silver plan: $500–$700/month (moderate deductible, $5,000–$7,000)
- Gold plan: $700–$900/month (low deductible, $1,000–$3,000)

**With subsidies (income qualifies):**
- Silver plan: $150–$300/month (after subsidy, much cheaper)
- Bronze plan: $50–$150/month (heavily subsidized)

## Who Qualifies for ACA Subsidies? This Changes Everything

ACA subsidies are income-based. If your income qualifies (roughly 100–400% of federal poverty line), your ACA costs drop dramatically.

**Example: 38-year-old, $50,000/year income, lives alone (2026 levels)**

- Federal poverty line: ~$14,500
- 400% of poverty line: ~$58,000
- Income qualifies for subsidies

- ACA Silver plan (pre-subsidy): $650/month
- Tax credit subsidy: ~$400/month
- **Your cost: $250/month**
- Year-1 cost: $3,000 + $5,000 deductible = $8,000 (worst case with claims)
- Or $3,000 if no claims

**CrowdHealth comparison:**
- Year-1 cost (zero claims): $1,680
- Year-1 cost (one $5,000 claim): $1,680 + $1,750 fees = $3,430

CrowdHealth is $1,320 cheaper for zero claims, ACA is cheaper for claim scenarios.

**Same person, $80,000/year income (no subsidy eligibility):**

- ACA Silver plan (pre-subsidy): $650/month = $7,800/year + deductible
- CrowdHealth: $140/month = $1,680/year + advisory fees

**CrowdHealth wins by $6,120/year** for this income level.

This is why CrowdHealth appeals to self-employed people—they often make too much for subsidies.

## Coverage Gaps: ACA vs CrowdHealth

**ACA provides:**
- Regulation and state oversight
- Guaranteed coverage (insurer obligation)
- No waiting periods for pre-existing
- Coverage up to out-of-pocket max ($9,100–$10,200)
- Mental health coverage (required by law)
- Prescription drug coverage (required)
- Preventive care (required, no cost-sharing)

**CrowdHealth provides:**
- No formal deductible
- No coverage caps (in theory)
- No waiting periods for new conditions (1-year for pre-existing)
- Voluntary community support (not guaranteed)
- Advisory fee costs that compound

## Mandate Compliance

**ACA:** Satisfies employer mandate, individual mandate (where it applies), and state requirements.

**CrowdHealth:** Satisfies none of these. If you need to satisfy a mandate, ACA is required.

## The Real Scenario

**Person: Age 42, self-employed, $75,000 income, no pre-existing conditions**

**ACA Route:**
- Income exceeds subsidy threshold
- Silver plan (pre-subsidy): $550/month
- Out-of-pocket max: $6,000
- Year-1 cost (zero claims): $6,600
- Year-1 cost (one $3,000 claim): $6,600 + $3,000 deductible = $9,600
- Mandate compliant: Yes

**CrowdHealth Route:**
- Monthly: $140
- Year-1 cost (zero claims): $1,680
- Year-1 cost (one $3,000 claim): $1,680 + $1,050 advisory fee = $2,730
- Mandate compliant: No

For this person, CrowdHealth saves $4,920–$6,870 year 1.

But if they're hit with a $50,000 claim:
- ACA: $6,600 + $6,000 deductible = $12,600
- CrowdHealth: $1,680 + $17,500 advisory fee = $19,180

ACA wins by $6,580 on catastrophic risk.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose CrowdHealth if:**
- You expect zero-to-few claims
- You don't qualify for ACA subsidies
- You can absorb advisory fee costs
- You don't need mandate compliance
- You have good savings for worst-case scenarios

**Choose ACA if:**
- You qualify for subsidies (income-based)
- You have pre-existing conditions
- You expect regular medical claims
- You need mandate compliance
- You want government regulation and guaranteed coverage

**The real question:** Do you qualify for ACA subsidies? If yes, ACA is likely cheaper overall. If no, CrowdHealth's monthly savings might be worth the advisory fee risk.

## Methodology

Comparison reflects 2026 ACA marketplace rates, CrowdHealth pricing, advisory fee structure, and subsidy income thresholds.
