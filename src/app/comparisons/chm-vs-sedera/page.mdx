CHM (Christian Healthcare Ministries) and Sedera occupy opposite corners of the health sharing market: CHM is the cheapest option at $115–$264/month but requires strict Christian faith commitment, while Sedera is explicitly non-religious at $180–$280/month with the highest coverage cap ($500K) but serves a much smaller community (8,000 members vs CHM's 100,000). The choice is straightforward: if faith matters or you want the lowest cost, choose CHM; if you want secular values with strong coverage, choose Sedera.

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | CHM | Sedera |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $115–$264 (cheapest) | $180–$280 |
| **Members** | 100,000 | 8,000 |
| **Pre-existing Wait** | 6 months | 6 months |
| **Coverage Cap** | $200,000 | $500,000 (highest) |
| **Faith Required** | Yes (strict) | No (explicitly secular) |
| **Tobacco Users** | Excluded entirely | Accepted |
| **Cost Advantage vs Sedera** | $65–$140/month cheaper | N/A |
| **Stability Risk** | Very low (100K members) | Moderate (8K members) |

**The fundamental trade:** CHM is cheaper but requires faith and lifestyle adherence. Sedera is pricier but offers secular values and higher coverage.

## CHM: The Budget Champion

CHM is the cheapest health sharing option in the US market at $115–$264/month. This isn't marginal—it's the lowest by a significant margin.

**Real annual cost comparison (no claims):**
- CHM: $115–$264 × 12 = $1,380–$3,168/year
- Sedera: $180–$280 × 12 = $2,160–$3,360/year
- Difference: CHM saves $780–$1,980/year

**Over 10 years, that's $7,800–$19,800 in cumulative savings.** For self-employed people or families on tight budgets, this is meaningful.

**The cost-to-coverage trade:**
- CHM: $115–$264/month covers up to $200,000 per incident
- Sedera: $180–$280/month covers up to $500,000 per incident

CHM's lower cost comes with a lower cap—but for 95% of people, a $200K cap is sufficient. Catastrophic risk above $200K is rare.

**The restrictions cost:**
CHM requires strict adherence to Christian lifestyle guidelines:
- Active Christian faith commitment
- No tobacco use (entirely excluded, not just higher rates)
- Adherence to Christian principles (can be subjective)

For someone aligned with these values, it's not a restriction—it's a natural fit. For someone secular or outside Christian theology, it's a dealbreaker.

## Sedera: The Explicit Secular Alternative

Sedera was founded specifically to serve secular/non-religious members who want health sharing without faith entanglement. Its $500,000 coverage cap is the highest in the mainstream market.

**The secular advantage:**
No faith requirements, no lifestyle restrictions rooted in Christian theology, and explicit community values alignment for non-religious members.

**The coverage advantage:**
$500,000 cap is double CHM's $200,000. For someone with serious health risks, this extra $300K cushion is valuable.

Real scenario: Someone diagnosed with cancer. Treatment plan: $400,000.
- CHM: Covers $200,000, you pay $200,000 out of pocket
- Sedera: Covers $400,000, you're covered (within the cap)

**The size trade:**
Sedera has 8,000 members. CHM has 100,000. 

Smaller pools carry theoretical risk—if a severe medical event year hits, reimbursements could be delayed or reduced. CHM's 100K-member base provides more stability.

Sedera hasn't experienced pool strain yet, but the risk exists.

## The Waiting Period Question

Both have 6-month pre-existing condition waits. If you join with a pre-existing condition, you pay 100% out of pocket for 6 months before the plan starts sharing.

For someone averaging $200/month in medical costs due to a chronic condition:
- 6 months × $200 = $1,200 out of pocket before coverage kicks in

Neither plan gives you an advantage here—it's a wash.

## Cost-Benefit Matrix

**If you're healthy with no pre-existing conditions:**
- CHM: $115–$264/month saves you money with adequate coverage
- Sedera: $180–$280/month costs more but provides higher cap

**If you have serious medical risk or diagnosis:**
- CHM: $200K cap might insufficient; you're liable for overages
- Sedera: $500K cap provides more security

**If you're secular or value secular community:**
- CHM: Uncomfortable fit due to faith requirements
- Sedera: Designed for this exact audience

**If you have low income/tight budget:**
- CHM: Lowest cost option available
- Sedera: Worth the extra $60–$140/month if cap or secular values matter

## The Real-World Scenario

**Scenario: You're 38, self-employed, health-conscious, no pre-existing conditions, secular values**

- CHM: $115–$264/month (let's say $150 for mid-age) = $1,800/year
- Sedera: $180–$280/month (let's say $220 for mid-age) = $2,640/year
- Difference: $840/year

If you don't file claims (healthy person scenario), CHM wins by $840/year.

If you file one claim worth $150,000 (within both caps), both cover it equally—Sedera's higher cap doesn't help on smaller claims.

If you file a claim worth $300,000, CHM pays $200K (you pay $100K), Sedera pays $300K (you pay $0). Sedera wins by $100K coverage.

**For most people:** CHM's cost advantage wins unless you have serious medical risk or secular values are non-negotiable.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose CHM if:**
- You want the lowest monthly cost ($115–$264/month)
- You're healthy with no serious medical risk
- You're comfortable with Christian faith requirements
- Budget is your primary concern

**Choose Sedera if:**
- You want non-religious health sharing
- You have serious medical risk (higher $500K cap)
- You can afford the extra $60–$140/month
- Secular community values are important to you

**Choose neither if:**
- You need caps above $500K (CrowdHealth has no caps)
- You can't afford the 6-month pre-existing wait (Zion covers day 1)
- You need to satisfy insurance mandates (health sharing doesn't count)
