Zion HealthShare ($185–$268/month) and Medi-Share ($227–$405/month) are the two mainstream health sharing options that accommodate the broadest range of people: Zion requires no faith commitment (as of Jan 2026) and covers pre-existing conditions day 1, while Medi-Share has 500,000 members, the largest member base for stability, but imposes a 12-month pre-existing wait and requires Christian faith commitment. The choice between them hinges on whether you have a pre-existing condition and whether faith matters to you.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Factor | Zion HealthShare | Medi-Share |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $185–$268 | $227–$405 |
| **Members** | 35,000 | 500,000 |
| **Pre-existing Wait** | **Immediate (day 1)** | 12 months |
| **Coverage Cap** | $250,000 | $350,000 |
| **Faith Required** | **No** (changed Jan 2026) | Yes |
| **Tobacco Users** | Accepted (higher cost) | Often excluded |
| **Waiting Period Costs (if pre-existing)** | $0 | $1,800–$3,600+ |
| **Year-One Cost (with pre-existing)** | $2,220–$3,216 + medical | $2,724–$4,860 + 100% medical |
| **Best For** | Pre-existing conditions; non-religious | Largest stable pool; faith-based community |

**The core difference:** Zion covers you from day 1 for any condition. Medi-Share waits 12 months. For someone with diabetes, hypertension, or any chronic condition, that waiting period can cost $1,800–$3,600+ out of pocket in year one.

## The Zion Advantage: Day 1 Pre-existing Coverage

Zion's single biggest advantage is the immediate pre-existing condition coverage. Join today, and eligible conditions are covered immediately—no waiting period.

This is huge for anyone with:
- Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Thyroid conditions
- Any chronic medication needs

Real cost impact: A person with diabetes averaging $300/month in medications joins Zion and pays $185–$268/month + medication sharing. Same person joins Medi-Share and pays $227–$405/month + 100% of medications for 12 months before sharing starts.

**Year-1 real cost:**
- Zion: $2,220–$3,216 + shared medication costs (~$300/month shared) = ~$6,000–$6,500
- Medi-Share: $2,724–$4,860 + 100% medication costs ($3,600/year) = ~$6,300–$8,500

For someone with a pre-existing condition, Zion is typically $500–$2,000 cheaper year one, and that advantage continues in year 2+.

**The faith requirement drop:** In January 2026, Zion eliminated its faith requirement. This makes it the only mainstream health sharing plan offering day-1 pre-existing coverage without faith restrictions—a unique market position.

## The Medi-Share Advantage: Size and Standardization

Medi-Share has 500,000 members—14x larger than Zion. This matters for:

1. **Pool stability.** Larger pools are less vulnerable to claim spikes. If a severe medical event year hits, a 500K-member pool absorbs it better than a 35K-member pool.

2. **Standardized processes.** Medi-Share has been operating since 1992 and has refined claim handling, appeals processes, and member support to an industrial level. Zion is more nimble but less established.

3. **Historical data.** Medi-Share has 30+ years of track records. You know what to expect. Zion's track record is good, but shorter.

4. **Faith-based community (if that matters to you).** If you want a faith-based healthcare community, Medi-Share is more developed than Zion.

**The cost trade:** Medi-Share costs $42–$137/month more than Zion. For someone without a pre-existing condition, that extra cost buys you the stability of a 30-year-old, 500K-member organization.

For someone *with* a pre-existing condition, the 12-month waiting period makes Medi-Share economically worse despite its size advantage.

## The Waiting Period Elephant in the Room

Let's be direct: if you have a pre-existing condition, Medi-Share's 12-month waiting period is its biggest weakness.

You pay full price for the first 12 months of eligible medical costs, then Medi-Share starts sharing. For people with chronic conditions requiring regular medications or doctor visits, this creates real hardship.

**Can you afford it?** If you have $2,000–$4,000 in savings to cover one year of medical costs out of pocket, Medi-Share becomes viable after the wait. If not, you can't afford Medi-Share despite its marketing.

Zion's day-1 coverage eliminates this problem entirely.

## Coverage Cap: $250K vs $350K

Zion caps at $250,000 per incident. Medi-Share at $350,000.

For most people, this difference is theoretical. But for someone facing cancer treatment ($400K–$600K), major accident, or transplant, the $100K difference matters.

**If you have serious medical risk:** Choose Medi-Share for the higher cap, or skip health sharing entirely and get insurance or CrowdHealth (no cap).

**If you're healthy:** Either cap is acceptable—the likelihood of hitting it is low.

## Faith Requirement: Zion's 2026 Game Changer

Until January 2026, both Zion and Medi-Share required faith commitments. Zion dropped the requirement; Medi-Share did not.

For secular people or those uncomfortable with faith-based healthcare, **Zion is now the only mainstream option** in this comparison.

For faith-based people who want the largest community, **Medi-Share remains the choice** due to its 500K-member base.

## The Real-World Scenario Test

**Scenario 1: You have Type 2 diabetes, age 40, self-employed**

- **Zion:** $230/month × 12 + $300/month medication (shared) = $2,760 + $3,600 = $6,360/year
- **Medi-Share:** $335/month × 12 + $300/month medication (100% out of pocket for 12 months) + $300/month medication (shared) for months 13–12 = $4,020 + $3,600 + $1,800 = $9,420/year

**Zion wins by $3,060/year.**

**Scenario 2: You're healthy, age 35, no pre-existing conditions**

- **Zion:** $200/month × 12 = $2,400/year (assuming no claims)
- **Medi-Share:** $300/month × 12 = $3,600/year (assuming no claims)

**Zion wins by $1,200/year**, but Medi-Share's larger pool provides more stability if you suddenly file a claim.

**Scenario 3: You have cancer diagnosed while insured elsewhere, want to join for ongoing treatment**

- **Zion:** Covers eligible cancer-related costs day 1 (up to $250K cap)
- **Medi-Share:** 12-month waiting period, then covers (up to $350K cap)

**Zion wins** if waiting period is unacceptable; **Medi-Share wins** if you can absorb the 12-month wait and have a higher cap need.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose Zion if:**
- You have a pre-existing condition (day-1 coverage is invaluable)
- You want non-religious health sharing (Zion is now the only mainstream option)
- You prioritize lower monthly costs
- You want to start coverage immediately

**Choose Medi-Share if:**
- You're healthy with no pre-existing conditions
- You value the largest member base and 30-year track record
- You want faith-based community alongside healthcare
- You need the higher $350K coverage cap for serious medical risk

**Choose neither if:**
- You need coverage above $350,000 (CrowdHealth has no caps)
- You can't absorb waiting period costs (Zion covers immediately, Medi-Share doesn't)
- You need to satisfy an insurance mandate (health sharing doesn't count)
