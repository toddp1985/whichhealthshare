Health sharing ministries (Zion, CHM, Medi-Share) and Presidio short-term insurance represent opposite approaches to healthcare costs: health sharing offers lower monthly premiums ($115–$405/month) with high deductibles, waiting periods, and coverage caps, while Presidio insurance costs $250–$450/month but provides actual insurance-level regulation, guaranteed coverage, no waiting periods, and predictable out-of-pocket limits. The choice hinges on whether you prioritize lowest monthly cost (health sharing) or guaranteed insurance protection (Presidio).

## Core Comparison

| Factor | Health Sharing Plans | Presidio Insurance |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $115–$405 | $250–$450 |
| **Type** | Unregulated pooling | Actual short-term insurance |
| **Pre-existing Conditions** | 6–12 month wait (except Zion) | Covered day 1 |
| **Coverage Cap** | $200K–$350K | Typically $500K–$1M |
| **Deductible** | None (pooled cost-sharing) | $2,000–$5,000 typically |
| **Regulation** | None (no state oversight) | Regulated by state insurance commission |
| **Mandate Compliance** | No | Yes |
| **Guaranteed Coverage** | No (community-dependent) | Yes (insurer obligation) |
| **Best For** | Healthy people, low-claim years | People needing insurance-level protection |

## Health Sharing: Lower Cost, Less Certainty

Health sharing costs $115–$405/month depending on the plan. This is genuinely cheap for healthy people.

**The catch:**
- Waiting periods delay coverage (6–12 months for pre-existing)
- Coverage caps create liability ($200K–$350K typical)
- Contributions are pooled, not legally guaranteed
- No state regulation or oversight
- Doesn't satisfy employer/mandate requirements

**Who it works for:** Healthy people under 50 with good savings and few expected claims.

**Who it doesn't work for:** People with pre-existing conditions, serious diagnoses, or low savings.

## Presidio: Insurance-Level Protection at Moderate Cost

Presidio is short-term insurance, not health sharing. It costs $250–$450/month, which is higher than most health sharing plans but lower than ACA insurance.

**What you get:**
- Actual insurance regulation and state oversight
- Pre-existing conditions covered day 1
- High coverage caps ($500K–$1M)
- Predictable deductibles and out-of-pocket limits
- Mandate compliance (satisfies employer/state requirements)
- Guaranteed claims payment (insurer obligation)

**The trade:** Higher monthly cost than health sharing, formal deductibles instead of pooled cost-sharing.

**Real cost scenario:** Presidio $300/month × 12 + $3,000 deductible = $6,600/year if you hit the deductible. Health sharing $200/month × 12 = $2,400/year if no claims.

Presidio costs more, but only if you file claims.

## Pre-existing Conditions: The Deal-Breaker

If you have a pre-existing condition:

**Health sharing:** 6–12 month wait (except Zion). Year-one cost for someone with diabetes: $2,000–$4,000 + 100% medical costs = $5,600–$8,600.

**Presidio:** Covered day 1, no waiting period. Year-one cost: $250–$450/month + medical costs = $3,000–$5,400 + deductible met = real cost depends on claims.

**Presidio wins decisively for pre-existing conditions.**

## Mandate Compliance: Insurance vs Non-Insurance

Health sharing does not satisfy:
- Employer mandate requirements
- ACA individual mandate (some states)
- State insurance requirements
- Loan/mortgage requirements

Presidio does satisfy all mandate requirements (it's actual insurance).

If you need to satisfy any healthcare mandate: **Presidio wins.**

## Cost Comparison: When Health Sharing Wins

Health sharing's advantage exists only for zero-claim, healthy people:

**Healthy 35-year-old, zero claims:**
- Health sharing: $150/month × 12 = $1,800/year
- Presidio: $300/month × 12 = $3,600/year

**Health sharing wins by $1,800.**

But the moment claims appear, the economics shift. A single $5,000 claim with health sharing advisory fees can quickly exceed Presidio's deductible.

## Coverage Cap Risk

Health sharing caps range from $200K–$350K. You're liable for anything above.

Presidio's caps are $500K–$1M. Much higher protection.

For cancer, major accident, or chronic illness requiring expensive ongoing treatment: **Presidio provides more security.**

## State Oversight and Recourse

Health sharing is unregulated. If a plan defaults or denies a claim unfairly, you have limited recourse. No state insurance commissioner to appeal to.

Presidio is regulated insurance. If the insurer denies a claim improperly, you can appeal to your state's insurance commissioner. This matters.

## Real-World Scenario

**Person: Age 50, diagnosed with hypertension, self-employed, no employer mandate**

**Health Sharing Path (Zion):**
- Monthly: $250
- Pre-existing wait: Immediate (Zion advantage)
- Year-1 cost: $3,000 + medication sharing (assume $200/month shared) = $3,000 + $2,400 = $5,400
- Coverage cap: $250,000

**Presidio Path:**
- Monthly: $350
- Pre-existing: Covered day 1
- Year-1 cost: $4,200 + $3,000 deductible + medication costs (assume covered at deductible) = $7,200
- Coverage cap: $750,000

For this person:
- Health sharing is $1,800 cheaper year 1
- But if they have major medical event, Presidio's higher cap ($750K vs $250K) provides more security

**Decision:** If risk-averse, Presidio. If budget-conscious and healthy, Zion.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose health sharing if:**
- You're healthy with few expected claims
- You want lowest monthly cost
- You can absorb waiting periods (Zion covers day 1)
- You don't need mandate compliance
- You have good savings for worst-case scenarios

**Choose Presidio if:**
- You have pre-existing conditions
- You need actual insurance protection
- You need to satisfy mandate requirements
- You want state-regulated recourse if claims are denied
- You want high coverage caps ($500K–$1M)

**Choose based on health status, not just price.**
