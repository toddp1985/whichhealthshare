Samaritan Ministries and CrowdHealth represent two fundamentally different health sharing philosophies: Samaritan is a traditional pooled health sharing ministry with faith-based community ($150–$350/month, 6-month pre-existing wait, $250K cap), while CrowdHealth is a healthcare crowdfunding platform with no faith requirement, no caps, but also no guaranteed contributions ($140/month + 30–43% advisory fees). The choice isn't about price—it's about whether you want community-pooled obligations (Samaritan) or voluntary crowdfunded assistance (CrowdHealth).

## Model Comparison

| Factor | Samaritan | CrowdHealth |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Model** | Pooled contributions (health sharing) | Crowdfunding (voluntary contributions) |
| **Monthly Cost** | $150–$350 | $140 base (+ 30–43% fees on claims) |
| **Members** | 40,000 | 15,000 (growing) |
| **Pre-existing Wait** | 6 months | 1 year (phased) |
| **Coverage Cap** | $250,000 | None (unlimited) |
| **Faith Required** | Yes | No |
| **Contribution Guarantee** | Yes (pooled obligation) | No (voluntary) |
| **Waiting Period Cost** | $600–$2,400 (6 months) | $1,200–$2,400 (1 year, phased) |
| **For Zero-Claim Year** | $1,800–$4,200 | $1,680 (cheapest) |
| **For $5,000 Claim** | $1,800–$4,200 + shared costs | $1,680 + $1,500–$2,150 (advisory fees) |

**The core difference:** Samaritan pools risk and guarantees sharing; CrowdHealth relies on voluntary contributions.

## Samaritan: The Community Model

Samaritan Ministries is the second-smallest major health sharing plan (40,000 members) but uniquely emphasizes community relationships.

**How it works:**
- You pay monthly ($150–$350)
- When you have a medical event, the ministry assigns you a "prayer partner"—another member who prays for your recovery and often sends encouragement
- Your claim is published (anonymized if you prefer), and the community contributes shares of your cost
- Most claims get fully funded

**Why people choose it:**
The community element is genuine. Members report feeling cared for in ways commercial insurance never provides. When you're sick, knowing another person is praying for you isn't just marketing—it's meaningful to many faith-based people.

**The community limitation:**
If you're not faith-oriented or if religious framing feels invasive, Samaritan is uncomfortable.

**The cost trade:**
$150–$350/month isn't cheap (only Medi-Share is more expensive), but you're paying for the community infrastructure.

## CrowdHealth: The Crowdfunding Model

CrowdHealth is a healthcare crowdfunding platform, not a traditional health sharing ministry. When you have a medical event, you submit the bill, and other members decide whether to contribute.

**How it works:**
- You pay $35–$40/month as an "advocate fee" (operational cost)
- When you need care, you submit the bill to CrowdHealth
- Members review your case and choose to contribute
- Most cases get 100% funding within 2–3 weeks
- CrowdHealth takes 30–43% of all contributions as advisory fees

**Why people choose it:**
- No faith requirement
- No coverage caps (truly unlimited)
- Contributions feel more voluntary than "obligation"
- Lower base monthly cost ($140 vs $150–$350)

**The voluntary contribution risk:**
Contributions are not guaranteed. While most cases get 100% funding, some get 80% funding or less. Full failures are rare (~1–2%) but possible.

## The Guarantee vs Voluntary Tension

This is the fundamental philosophical difference:

**Samaritan guarantees sharing.** You pay monthly, and when you have an eligible claim within guidelines, the community shares it. It's a contractual obligation.

**CrowdHealth relies on voluntary contributions.** Members choose to help. Most do. Sometimes they don't.

If you value certainty: Samaritan wins.  
If you value freedom and lower cost: CrowdHealth wins.

## Real Cost Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Healthy person, zero claims, full year**

- Samaritan: $150–$350/month × 12 = $1,800–$4,200/year
- CrowdHealth: $140/month × 12 = $1,680/year

**CrowdHealth wins by $120–$2,520/year** for zero-claim people.

**Scenario 2: One $5,000 claim (urgent care, medications)**

- Samaritan: $1,800–$4,200 + shared costs (probably $0–$500 out of pocket)
- CrowdHealth: $1,680 + $1,500–$2,150 (advisory fees) = $3,180–$3,830 + claim costs

**Samaritan wins** for a single moderate claim due to no advisory fees.

**Scenario 3: $250,000+ medical event (cancer, major surgery)**

- Samaritan: Covers up to $250K, you pay the overage
- CrowdHealth: No cap (unlimited), but 30–43% advisory fee on the full amount

If treatment costs $400,000:
- Samaritan: Covers $250K, you pay $150K out of pocket
- CrowdHealth: Members share $400K, CrowdHealth takes ~$120K–$170K in fees, you pay fees ($120K–$170K out of pocket)

Both result in $120K–$170K out-of-pocket cost, but via different mechanisms.

## Faith Requirement: Deal-Breaker for Some

Samaritan requires Christian faith commitment. CrowdHealth doesn't.

For secular people: **CrowdHealth wins decisively.**  
For faith-based people: **Samaritan wins** (community values alignment).

## Member Stability and Scale

Samaritan has 40,000 members (larger than Zion's 35,000 but smaller than Medi-Share's 500,000).

CrowdHealth has 15,000 members (growing rapidly).

Larger pools are theoretically more stable. Smaller pools carry higher risk if a bad year hits. Neither has failed, but the scale matters for long-term confidence.

## The Waiting Period Problem

Both have waiting periods for pre-existing conditions:
- Samaritan: 6 months
- CrowdHealth: 1 year (phased: $25K→$50K→$100K)

For someone with a pre-existing condition, both create year-one hardship. CrowdHealth's phased coverage is slower but more gradual.

## The Bottom Line

**Choose Samaritan if:**
- You want guaranteed community sharing (not voluntary)
- You value faith-based healthcare community
- You can afford $150–$350/month
- You want predictable costs without percentage-based fees

**Choose CrowdHealth if:**
- You want no coverage caps
- You don't want faith requirements
- You're healthy with few claims (no advisory fee impact)
- You like the crowdfunding/voluntary community model

**Choose neither if:**
- You have a pre-existing condition and can't absorb waiting period costs (Zion covers day 1)
- You need mandate-compliant coverage (health sharing doesn't count)
- You're uncomfortable with voluntary contributions (CrowdHealth) or faith (Samaritan)
