  "aiSummary": "JHS Community, also known as Jericho Health Share, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit health care sharing ministry based in Houston, TX, offering catastrophic-focused health sharing at some of the lowest monthly costs in the industry. The DIVINE product line includes three tiers: Distinct (most affordable, $250K/year cap, 50% co-share after MRA), Diverse (balanced, $750K/year cap, 20% co-share), and Dynamic (most comprehensive, $1M/year cap, 0% co-share). Members choose a Member Responsibility Amount (MRA) of $2,500, $5,000, or $10,000. The plans include MDLIVE telehealth, Drexi prescription discounts, and access to the First Health/PHCS network with over 1 million providers. Notable limitations include no mental health sharing, limited maternity coverage (Diverse/Dynamic only with 9-month wait), a 12-month pre-existing conditions waiting period, and unavailability in 17 states. The organization has faced regulatory scrutiny, including settlements with New Hampshire and North Dakota attorneys general.",
