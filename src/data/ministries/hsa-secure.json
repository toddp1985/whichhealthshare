  "aiSummary": "HSA Secure, offered by MPowering Benefits (MPB Health), is the only health sharing plan designed specifically for HSA compatibility. It combines a special HSA-qualified MEC (minimum essential coverage) preventive health insurance plan with a low-cost healthshare powered by Zion HealthShare. This unique structure allows members to contribute pre-tax dollars to an HSA while enjoying affordable monthly sharing contributions starting at $170/month for individuals. The plan covers preventive care, telehealth ($0 consultations via Primestin Care), prescriptions (via Zion RxShare), maternity (after 6-month wait), emergency, and surgery. It has no network restrictions, no annual or lifetime caps, and no faith requirements. The trade-off is that mental health is not directly shareable and pre-existing conditions face a phased sharing schedule.",
