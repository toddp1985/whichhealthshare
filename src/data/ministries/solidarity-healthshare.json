  "aiSummary": "Solidarity HealthShare is a Catholic-centered health sharing ministry founded in 2016 in Tempe, AZ with approximately 50,000 members. It offers three plans: Solidarity ONE (comprehensive, $149-$599/mo), SAVVY (young adults 18-29, starting at $85/mo), and SHIELD (catastrophic, starting at $67/mo). Uses reference-based pricing with no provider network. The ONE plan provides best-in-class mental health coverage (unlimited counseling, medication, hospitalization) and maternity including midwives and home births. Requires Catholic or Christian faith with church attendance. Major concerns include extremely slow claims processing (6-24 months reported) and poor member satisfaction ratings.",
