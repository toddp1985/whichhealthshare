How to use this calculator:
1. Enter your plan's IUA (Initial Unshared Amount / Deductible)
2. Enter your plan's coinsurance percentage
3. For each scenario, you'll pay: IUA + (percent coinsurance on costs beyond IUA)

SCENARIO BREAKDOWN:

Scenario 1: Minor Care (Doctor Visit + Antibiotics)
- Doctor visit: $150
- Antibiotics: $30
- Total medical cost: $180
- YOU PAY: Your IUA (up to $500) = $180 (less than IUA)
- Your cost: $180 (if you haven't hit your IUA yet)

Scenario 2: Surgery (Appendectomy)
- Surgery + hospital: $15,000
- YOU PAY: Your IUA + 20% coinsurance on $14,500 = $2,900 + IUA

Scenario 3: Chronic Condition (Diabetes Management)
- 3 doctor visits x $150 = $450
- Monthly supplies = $100 x 12 = $1,200
- Total: $1,650/year
- YOU PAY: Your IUA + 20% of $1,150 = IUA + $230

Scenario 4: Major Event (Cancer Treatment)
- Chemotherapy + hospital: $50,000
- YOU PAY: Your IUA + 20% coinsurance on $49,000 = IUA + $9,800

Compare your actual plan's costs to these scenarios to understand your true expenses.
